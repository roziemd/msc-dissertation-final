                They call me by whatsapp  it was strange for this number but DBS logo convinced me to answer.

The Whatsapp profile was DBS logo, so I answer, and they say my card was blocked.
then they ask me my ID number .... this finally explain me that it was false.

So I replied saying that I would go to the branch for my card. They tried to convince me to do at the phone, but I will not give them any data. They then ended the call.

                I rceived a call from a lady claiming to be calling from singtel.  She started off a call with ""how are you today"". She had an indian accent and her call quality was very spotty, sounded like an internet call. She told me they had detected some issue with my router and internet connection. She proceeded to ask me to check how many blinking lights there were on my router. I started getting suspicious about her EXPLANATION and requests. 

She then asked me how many devices are connected to my router.

I could barely hear her over the call as her volume was very low, so she eventually transferred me to a ""Senior technician"" who was a man who also had an indian accent.  He also started off the call with ""how are you today""

He proceeded to explain that they have been detecting some unusual activity in my router from 12am to 6am and that unauthorised people were trying to access my internet. He wanted to ""seek my cooperation"" to follow his instructions to rectify this issue. he told me to get a device, phone or computer so I went to take my laptop and quickly googled ""singtel scam"" to which I found the description of this scam. 

He then told me to go to ""spotlight search"" on my mac, to which i promptly hung up the phone.

Please be wary of such scam phone calls.

                details: I received a call from what seemed like a Singapore mobile phone (91617809), so I picked up without suspicion at first. It was an automated computer generated voice claiming to be from the Singapore High/ Supreme Court. The caller claims that I was issued a Summon or have been summoned by the Court, and requested me to press on '9' for more details. My family were around me back then, and having heard news about the recent Court scam calls news, asked me to immediately end the call, which I did. I then did my research, and am aware that I have just received a scam call. 

ANY LOSS: I HAD NO ACTUAL LOSS OF PERSONAL INFORMATION AND ETC,  SO I HAVE YET TO MAKE A POLICE REPORT. 

FYI: I also had an experience RECEIVING a scam message from a self-claimed bank (number: 31594622) under a realistic name ""smsalert"". 
what happened in the end: I later verified/ did my research with actual DBS, and they have kindly assured me that it was nothing but a scam message. 

SOme tips that might be helpful
1. BANK WILL NOT ASK FOR YOUR ATM CARD DETAILS OVER PHONE! 
2. NEVER CARELESSLY SHARE YOUR BANK DETAILS/ FINANCIAL INFORMATION AND PERSONAL INFORMATION OVER PHONE!   

Hopefully less people, especially the elderly and the vulnerable, will get scammed in the future and Thanks everyone for the effort in helping to combat scams, let's do our best to help raise awareness!

1) An impersonated junior technical staff called me at home saying from their server end, saw many ppl using my internet. He asked me check fibre router and turned off devices connected to wifi


2) He asked me to type command ""assoc"" on laptop and he was able to tell me the long code-starting with 888....... Asked me to trust him, as only Singtel will know my pc code no. As it is an unique identifier. 


3) He forwarded my call to senior singtel technical staff to type command ""netstat"" to show my internet is being cyber attacked and forwarded me to impersonated cyber defence security of singapore personnel to report this case. 


4) Then he asked me to type command to install an app ""team viewer"" and he was able to control my pc
 5) He asked to login my bank accounts and told me will input money in my account and transfer to my other account to nab the cyber attackers. He even able to change the value in my account using html script to trick me that he is inputting money.

                Hi I received a whats app from someone called Zu Lan. She wanted my email rather than phone. Sounded odd but I gave it. I received the following message which sounded odd so i looked online and found lots of similar stories. (but people have lost money) Zu Lan's email

Thank you for  replying to me. My name is Zhu Lan, 36 years old, a single and non-smoker lady. I am willing to rent the room. I am at sea at the moment as i work on a cruise ship as a Chef offshore of Philippines


I will be living and working down there as my contract here is coming to an end that's why I am coming there. But due to the nature of my work of having a busy schedule, phone calls making and visiting websites are restricted, I only squeezed out time to check this advert and send you a message so I won't be able to come for the viewing myself.

I will like you to kindly calculate the total cost covering my first six months rent together with a deposit and I will be staying for long as your room is available.


Please kindly get back to me with some pictures of the room and your address for me to forward it to my mover agent to calculate the total cost of moving my stuff over there. I have attached my IC with this email for you to have a view of me. Looking forward to read back from you soon.

                This man is from China and claimed live in Hong kong working in corporation that issue business license for company that wants to register in Hong Kong.


This person was in my wechat for a long time, We never meet in person and did not talk much until 3/14/2020 Shelter in place started that we talk more about work and daily life like a friend.  He will say good morning and good night on daily basis, and ask more about how my day goes etc.  He also ask if I want to plan about house purchase (kind of weird but chat between friend about buying house is normal) or do investment since I seem so trouble about money. The chat goes on about 2 months.


He then confess to me that he think I'm his soulmate and wants to spend the rest of his life with.  He keep promised me that once I'm able to to go Hong Kong, he will take care of me and bring me around. the whole romantic word you can think of to cox a girl. he become more interested about how I manage my finance, (first alert).  7/6/2020 he said he will be busy with a new company's licensing and hope I can help him manage his Chinese lottery account online site MACAU Venetian.  Being too helpful, I assisted him, submit bet for him.  Later he start to convince me to register my login to the site and claim as a good investment in lottery for fast money since I'm helping out his account.  (Alert 2, and I done research and found the site only register online 2 months old).  I did went in to do a simple register and the site's live CSR chat give a personal bank account for transfer money (BIg alert).  I refused to do what he ask, he begin become aggressive over Wechat and trying to sound reasonable that he is helping me; while I'm bring unseasonable and stubborn. I ended up telling him no and blocked him.


1. Never fully trust a person you never meet in person. Especially someone claim to be from China but work in Hong Kong on any social media.

2. Always do more research and investigation of any website given from the possible scammer.

3. scammers are professional at ID your personality and work like a Psychologist. don't give in to coxing, It is your hard earn money at stake.

I received a call from “John” from Singtel internet service provider to inform that my wifi router is being used illegally by other parties. he asked me to follow a set of instructions in computer to check and block the other users. I followed first few steps and then realised it was a scam call when he asked for passwords and other details of the system. I ended the call and stopped following his instructions. but he didn't budge and forced me to continue to follow those steps in system's command prompt. 
He called again 5mins later from another number without caller id. I ended and blocked the call.  
i'm worried about my privacy and that he might hack my computer or internet.

Indeed when they helped me to verify that the call was fake, and that moh calls are always in person, never automated.

On 08 july 2020 around 0845hrs received a call +65 6915 7851. Robocall claimed that from ministry of health [moh] and required go to the nearest check-up centre.

This person by the name marian franco stephanie reached out to me through meetup group, saying that she wants to be friend and wanted to talk to me via Whatsapp as she is from ny and coming to sg for work and possibly looking at signing a contract in Singapore soon. 
The number this person reached out is +1(217)5164789. Within a few days of messaging, she said she was coming to singapore through a private jet and would be here for 3 days for contract and job interview which amounted to millions. 
She started asking all personal questions and started sending inappropriate pics, which I later realised when I googled that this person is taking stealing the pictures from a model instagram page name marian franco who is from mexico. 
She claimed to return back to ny and asked for help to pay her real-estate agent about S$3000  and she wanted to end it once she is back to sg permanently for her work. She also sent a fake contract. When I challenged on the address given on the contract, the person put it onto the agent and said that's why she needed help as she couldn’t trust the agent if they are legitimate. Later she came back with an excuse saying she found another property and asked me to contact the agent @ +65858925?? and pay him the money and take the key from him. I got bit afraid as the address she shared this time is just within a mile of my house.
I politely asked her to back off any not message me again. While i reported the number on whatsapp, i'm not sure if i shall be making a police report as it's bit scary if this person is actually tracking me physically. 
Beware friends!

our internet account is not under my wife's name
we have never been told to provide a ID number before
she was unable to identify our singtel account number for verification
she tried to get us to run a command on our pc

I was approached by a lady from china who goes by the name ""jiang lin"" on wechat. She claims to be from a well-to-do family from beijing and has an ""uncle"" who is a financial expert.
After a couple of text exchanges she introduced me to invest in a cryptocurrency known as ""obb"", trading on a cryptocurrency online platform known as ""bftbit"" (www.bftbit.com). Bftbit turns out to be a fake trading platform and obb is a non-existent cryptocurrency. Once monies are deposited into bftbit it goes directly to the scammers, although on bftbit it reflects as deposited into your bftbit account and no matter how you try to withdraw the monies, the withdrawal status would remain as ""processing"".
In the beginning i was very skeptical and refused to believe her. But a moment of greed and ""too smart for my own good"" led me to foolishly believe in her and lost an unrecoverable sum of s$14,500.
The modus operandi:
1) she would first introduce that she had been into this obb investment for 3 years under the guidance of her financial expert uncle who guides her to invest at the relevant time on bftbit which most of the time would be profit-making as the uncle knows the market.
2) she would ask you to invest in a small sum of us$500 first which would make profits after 2 rounds of investment on bftbit. She would also provide step-by-step guidance [i.e. buying of cryptocurrency on huobi (an authentic ans well-known cryptocurrency exchange incorporated in singapore), transferring of currency from huobi to bftbit, making trades in obb on bftbit and withdrawal and transferring of a small sum of currency from bftbit to huobi (this withdrawal is to make one believe that bftbit is an authentic trading platform but in fact the withdrawal is done by the scammers)]. From there, she would entice you to invest in us$10,000 as her uncle predicts that a big market trend is coming, thus earning more profit.
3) she would then suggest to make a joint trade of usd$20,000 which would require us$30,000 as security deposit. In order to gain your trust, she would transfer us$40,000 into your bftbit account. Once you transfer your us$10,000 into the account it is gone forever.
4) at the time when you (and her) are jointly trading on the obb big market trend, the trading system would stop for unknown reason and when you refresh the trading system you would realise that the joint trade suffers an 80% loss. From there, she would claim to be your fault and ask for refund of her us$40,000.
5) a much serious concern is that in setting up your account with bftbit you need to furnish a copy of your nric which is at the scammers' disposal.

                met a girl through Tinder and proceed to Whatsapp. After chatting for a while, she asked if we wanted to do a video call to chat. I was bored so I agreed. shortly after the chat did get a bit flirty and then we proceed to get butt naked over the video call. shortly after she ended the call and said it was laggy, so she sent a link (DO NOT FALL FOR THIS) and said why not we chat at her private room. To login, is to put your number and the room number of hers. Stupidly I did it and shortly after she sent a video saying it got recorded and threaten to send it to my family and friends. the ""manager"" later called and threatened to send if I don't transfer money to him now. I did not even have the time to react or to think. but luckily I managed to negotiate not to send the full amount. but still, money was still lost in the process. 

If you received such threats, just block their numbers straight away and just ignore. 
Yes, I know you are afraid that they might send cos I was in the same situation as you. But just make a police report and block their numbers. because I believe even if you send the full amount, they will demand more. It's never-ending, I was lucky that I negotiated to only send half over.  

Brothers, I understand the needs or desires that we fall into. but learn from my mistake, don't do online video call ever. Even if the girl seems genuine. Cos mine did too. And I admit I had some indecent video calls before but I never thought I would be a victim of this. Never get complacent. if their number ever starts with +852 esp, do not contact them ever.

                At 29 June 2020, SGT 2.24pm. I received 1 call on my whatsapp. 

The caller had the DBS paylah logo as his avatar with an Indian male on the line claiming to be from dbs paylah. i believe he was asking for my personal details as i could not make out what he was saying; so i hung up the call.

i received a second call less than 5 minutes later, with the same guy explaining that he is from dbs paylah. once again, as i could not fully understand what he was saying, i asked for him to reconfirm the details. he did not, and started pressing me for my nric and banking details; so i hung up a second time.

The caller mentioned something along the lines of my ""Paylah"" account was going to be deactivated after some time and he needed my NRIC to confirm if it was mine. 

I hung up immediately.

I was just doing my own business and the phone rang. There was a brief silence and a lot of 'hello-ing' back and forth. Then she said, with a thick Indian accent, 'Hi, i am calling from singtel regarding the intermittent connectivity issues.'. 

It's true that I was facing some issues but seeing that number and that telecos don't make such unsolicited phone calls telling their customers that they have issues with their internet, I hung up.

                I got to know jerry cheung from tantan apps, we move on to wechat to continue for chatting.

Like a similar story shared, he told me that he is a Russian, i knew her start from august 2019.

That's how we start our ""love story""

I lost a lot of money. The worse case is when i cannot continue to supply him the money, he tried to threaten me.

first time he requested the money, is when he said the building he erected is collapsed.
asked the money from me for around EUR5000 to rescue him.
i paid him with doubt, i cannot search any similar story or name online.

few weeks later, the victims in the collapsed building die.
the victim family asked for compensation, for EUR20,000.
He said he has a very good lawyer to represent him.
the lawyer paid EUR15,000 and i only need to pay eur5000 so that he can go back to russia and start his life again.
after a very long time dragging between us, i ""help"" him again.

one weeks later, the victim uncle came back from china, and said the earlier compensation is not suffcient.
they asked for another EUR15,000 (if i not mistaken), the lawyer paid EUR8000 and i top up another EUR7000.
how stupid i am is i still help him with EUR5000.

he can anytime spam me, ask the money from me, cry in the phone call, etc.

this is not the end of the story. few days later, he suddenly missing.
the 'lawyer' start to appear in the story.
the lawyer said the day when he was at the airport and waiting for the departure, airport staffs found there is drugs in his bag.
and he dunno how this could happened. 

The lawyer told me, we can rescue him by paying money to the Indonesian authority.
he got the 'lubang' where all these can settle under table. Asked for USD20,000 from me to rescue him.

I told him that i won't pay him. he show me the photo with the prison wear.
I've told him that I won't pay as I don't have the money anymore.

few days later, he said if i dun pay, he will inform the indonesia authority that i will get involve with the drug case as well.

He said he would do something nasty to me. When I felt that my life is being threaten at that time, and i make the police report at that night.

I was vulnerable when I got into a relationship with him and I hope that my story can help alert the other ladies out there in search of love online. 

To all the ladies out there, please don't trust other people easily.

Without looking, i thought it was an sg mobile number. the caller identified himself from singtel and that there has been abnormally high use of data on my home wifi for the past few days. this indicates a possible hack to my home wifi and singtel noticed that there were more than 20 uses for my wifi.


as the first step, he needed us to verify our home wifi number. he guided us on the computer to a DOS command screen to type in some simple commands. he then read out this set of info - 888DCA60-FC0A-11CF-8F0F-00C04FD7D0?? - which is also on our screen. This helped him prove that he's from Singtel (as only singtel has this info about my home wifi).  to work with us to troubleshoot the hacking. 

He then asked for our confidential information like nric number, wifi password and router number.


We started our search online and found that this is a scam. We immediately ended the call.

1) - match zhenxi via tinder. She started the conversation but will soon divert the conversation to wechat, asking me to add her.
She will share that she’s someone who travels around often maintaining her trading business based in guangzhou shenzhen. She will come off as someone who is financially capable, emphasizing her knowledge in investing as a side business to maintain the high standard of livings there.
For the first few days, she would attempt to phish for personal information (location, salary, interest, investment knowledge, close relatives). Slowly, the conversation will progress to how she and her friend invest during their free time and earning fast bucks. Never in the conversation would she encourage you to join in investing, nor would she ask you to lend her money. 
When you ask for more info, she would offer her help for free to teach you how to invest. 
Next, she would direct you to this 'trading platform' (ccysu?.com), which shows a dashboard with various currency exchange and a crypto-coin. She asked to set up an account, and from there will send you another wechat account (trading platform support contact), asking you to seek advice from there for information of transfer of funds to the platform. 
The platform consultant will then send you a local account information of transfer of funds. Sometimes another account number will be given if the you mentioned the transferring amount is substantial. Platform consultant as sop will direct you a company's link and prove that they are a global customer. 
A smart move so that if anything happens, the blame would be on the platform, not the girl. 
3) personal info, money, time and effort all will be lost if one is to fall for this trap. I can only assume that you can 'trade' on the platform for the first couple of days or weeks since the scammer is only asking for a small amount of money to be invested initially. The platform is fake, so an easily manipulated bear chart will have you keep buying in for cost averaging down, unknowingly pumping in more money to the 'platform'.
To add, I believe is critical to continue the conversation even when realising that it is a scam. This way, counter scamming would enable us to phish more details from scammers and their operating sop. To that end of course never transfer any money or personal info to achieve it.

I contact seller through whatsapp (83792917) and He counter offer at $300 and told us to make a direct bank transfer. i worried this is a scam so he offer a deposit of $200 instead, he even provide me with an NRIC (both side copy) to make me feel safe. coming to think of it now, the nric must have belong to some other victim as well. anyway, story is, i transfer the $200 to posb-??8032065 and was told to contact his boss for the item. through whatsapp (83022302) with the boss, he told me to make the remaining payment if we want to get the item cos his staff is new and not too sure of the procedure. once again, $100 was transfer, this time to another bank account (posb-??6470451). then we are told that we need to make another payment of $100 as delivery fee. only then, did i realise this is a scam... i confront the boss, as usual it is pointless, then i told him i wanted a refund... of cos there is no refund so my money is gone...

                the caller call my mobile 91118608 at 10:17am today 20th june 2020 using this mobile number 91395841.

He say he (indian guy) is calling from Singtel technical department and say that someone is tapping on my home internet to use, so he is going to teach me how to remove the person from using my home internet.

he ask me to log in to my laptop and key something from the keyboard which i do not understand, so i keep asking him for more verification as i suspect he is not calling from singtel.

So, i asked him what is my singtel account number, he say he is not from accounts department and do not have my account details.

Then, I told him him i don't think he is calling from singtel and he hung up the call.

I called back the number and voice record say : the singtel mobile customer is not available.

i have block this mobile number on my mobile phone.

Caller claimed from Singtel internet provider (I'm using Starhub). 

He shared that many unauthorized users were using my internet. 

Said will help me to resolve the issue and ask me to check on laptop netstat on internet activities. Highlighted that many foreign IPs were detected. 

Put me to his supervisor to help celar the unauthorized users. Supervisor asked me to download anydesk.com to access my laptop... Found it fishy, due to background road noise, wrong internet subscriber... Hang up and call starhub to verify.

                The caller claim to be a network security specialist calling from ""Microsoft Network"" security. 

They claimed that your home network is being compromised by hacker and the hackers can access your computer to steal information. In order for you to believe them they will ask you to open the program command prompt for windows or terminal for mac. They will ask you type netstat and hit enter. Upon doing that, you will see a list of active internet connections. the caller will claim that these are the foreigner addresses now accessing your computer. they will ask you to connect to their secure server to allow them to remotely access to your computer. 

Do not give anyone remote access to your computer as this would allow them to access info saved on your computer or monitor what you are doing!

Upon our probing, he immediately cut off the call. subsequently we called up singtel and was told that they will not actively call up customers to notify about internet issues. most of the time, internet problems were raised by customers instead.

                This lady with a south-Asian / middle-eastern accent called with this international number to my office line. I thought that it was a work call and picked it up. She introduced herself as calling from Singtel and wanted to talk to me about my internet connection issues. I have been working from home for a while now, and my home internet is from another Telco company and is not under my name. My office is using Singtel, but nobody is there using the internet and I am not the person listed as a contact for internet issues. Therefore I thought her calling me was weird. 

I told her that I don't use Singtel, and she said ""Yeah I know, but let me tell you about Singtel. Singtel is the mother internet provider for whole of Singapore..."" before she could finish I just cut off the call. It was so obviously a scam and a waste of time. Beware, people!!

I checked the number and based on the country code, the call is from Kazakhstan. I don't think Singtel has a base there and would direct my internet connection issues to an overseas call centre. They probably didn't think I'd see the number because she called a land-line. So be careful if you can't see the caller ID! Ask questions to verify before providing any information! besides, she doesn't even know my name!

                I met him on Tinder. we chatted for awhile there before moving to whatsapp.
he was nice, decent and very respectful. he called me briefly after a week of chatting and asked me to call back in 2 hours time. but he never answered my call and only apologised for missing the call (But never called back)

two weeks of chatting he said he is interested in me and looking forward to meeting post circuit breaker. 
there was not a single suspicion that he is a love scammer/fake person as he has never asked anything other than my photos.

i questioned him for not having a video call and he said i was unstable and went missing for few days but he replied when i reached out to him - we reconnected and things get better. he declared his love and always wrote me nice words to start my day. we have planned to meet now that phase 2 is coming soon, he suggested his place so he can cook for us.
our chat turned flirty  once or twice and then back to normal. although we chatted less, the quality of the conversation got better.

he left me a 'good night and sweet dreams Bae' with a heart emoticon on midnight, i replied in the morning and i didn't hear anything anymore. the following day he was no longer there and his number (digital phone number) belongs to someone else out of singapore now.

i don't know the intention of the communication - i may not lose anything material but my emotional is really affected by this encounter.
it has been almost a week but i still couldn't move on - what actually happened? this is a question i will never get the answer  on.

Be careful with whom you are talking to online and if the person expresses his affection for you very early on, something is WRONG! Don't get affected like me.

I can tell that they are using a VOIP to spoof call a local number because there is lag when I respond to them. Also, calling the number back, returns an invalid number. A quick search shows that they are spoofing a singtel number.

Another sign that this is a scam is both persons I spoke to were indian men with generic english names like John. this is a dead give away that they are a scam center located in india. do your research, there is a huge wave of indian scammers that will try their luck on unsuspecting people who might not know what is going on with their internet providers. 

wasted his time by pretending to not know how to use my computer.
Take note of these scammers as they will try to get you to most probably get you to log onto their website and steal your credit card details or get you to pay money.

To anyone reading this, do Understand that ISP and telcos will never call you using a handphone number.  

If someone you don't know asks for your personal details or ask you to download some programmes, don't do it.

The call just claim that she noted my internet have issued and not stable. And immediately i am alert straight away from the scam call. 1st of all, she don't sound professional. 
Plus singtel technical won't make unsolicited phone calls to their customers if we never make a report on technical issues.

And the person called from a handphone number. I hanged up because it sounded too scammy.

He gave his name as 'Alex murphy', but spoke with a strong indian accent. I asked for this identification number but he randomly gave 3 letters and 4 digits as the number. 

I told him that i would call Singtel to check his identity, and he even dared me to do it.

                I met this fraudster on a social network, it was my birthday, and he asked me address, phone and other personal information, to send me a gift, I thought flowers, as romantic as I am. And instead I was contacted to pick up a package of 12 kg, at a cost of $2500 USD.
At the payment request I was given an account number sent to me with a strange royal express email <[email protected]> :

Name : Khiew Tze M??
Account number : ???-5-043407
Bank : OCBC bank
Swift Code: OCBCSGSG

To be made with an ATM cash payment.
Of course I did not do it, the figure is very high, although in the package the crook had later told me to pick it up because it contains, two bags of value, bracelet earrings and necklace, white and yellow gold, a watch and an iphone.

Let me say we knew each other for a week.

                two weeks ago i was looking for a job online and i came across this job listing ""Home based Personal Assistant"" so I whatsapp the number on the listing. The guy told me that the job scope was to receive funds and record transactions from their sales rep. So upon reviewing and approving my CV, he asked for my bank details and I gave it to him.

The next day he notified me that a certain amount of money has been credited because of sales. He said I have to record it down and then transfer the money out to another bank account. I just did what he told me to do for the next couple of days AS I thought my main job purpose was to record the transactions. Until 2-3 days later I found out that my bank account had been frozen. I panicked and called the bank, they said my account was under investigation by the police. So I called the police and they told me to go down and give a statement because I am now involved as the account is mine. i hope no one else encounters a case like this because it is horrible. I know nothing about money laundering and nothing about laws and the police so this was very frightening for me.

                I almost fell prey to an Internet Love scam.

I met on dating app tinder. I got connected to this boy 3 weeks ago, he said he was based in UK and asked me for my WhatsApp number to be able to talk frequently, soon he became very emotional and attached and calling everyday.  Last week around 4th June, 2020 I suggested to do a video call over the coming weekend , which he agreed to, however , he did not make it for that virtual date and I was really upset and deleted my tinder profile and his contact from WhatsApp.  The next day I was bombarded with calls and texts apologising and promising to make up for it. I was expecting a video call however, I was told that he has bought some gifts for me and would like to send it over. I felt weird and resisted in giving my address for delivery but after bit of persuasion from his end I gave in and provided my email, full name and address to him. The next morning when I woke up I saw his message with the courier receipt stating the parcel weight as 45 kgs. I was in a shock that how can someone send so much stuff, I was also provided the tracking number and saw that the delivery was due on 11th June,2020. I tried asking him what was in the parcel but he said its a surprise, later he called me again to and while chatting he said he has also put in some cash for me to buy something of my own choice. I felt there was something seriously wrong and soon after i.e today at 9:40am I received an email from the shipping company saying parcel has arrived in singapore but is due taxes and import duty of S$4,500 and I need to respond to them about how I will be making a payment. That is when I was sure this is a scam.

An Indian lady was on the line claiming that she's calling from singtel as they observed that there has been more than 20 users connected to my WIFI. She confirmed if she was speaking to the account holder, if we have been facing WIFI issues (which we indeed Have), if we have good password practices, the number of devices we have connected to our wifi. The first time i questioned her identity, she responded that she has been authorised by singtel to follow up with customers with this issue. She then requested for me to use a laptop and follow her instructions to reveal the ip addresses of the unauthorised users. that is when i questioned her identity a second time, given that there was no call from singtel prior to this call and that she was calling from a private mobile number. 

She then hung up immediately.

                So I thought with this circuit breaker, this can be an opportunity for me to make new friends and expand my dating scene. So i tried tinder and got matched with a couple of guys.

The standard MO is get your whatsapp number, then start chatting with you, and very quickly ""falling in love"" with you. 

standard sob stories are:
1. wife died in an accident (don't want to talk about it)
2. only child with a very old grandmother
3. only child with a very strong single mother

all have local numbers, mostly registered as business whatsapp numbers. as time goes by, you will notice cracks in their stories (for example - pictures can be found online, and like they probably stole other people's profiles during their other scams and used it for the chat)

can't meet because their phone camera's don't work, spoilt, would call you to appease you. may sound foreign but if you listen carefully, you will hear either a recorded bot. they might work in groups - some might be smarter than others in terms of their playbook

Language - grammar and spelling are really bad (especially if they say they are professionals and westerners)

Will ask you tons of questions but will never answer yours. so will ask about family, work, are you single, and are you living alone. and they will shape their answers to you based on your answers to prove that you two match and connect.

Just pay attention, do your research, avoid sharing too much until you meet them.

Someone should write to these dating apps and ask them to seriously review their member verification process. #justsaying

Doesn't matter what app - tinder, coffee whatever bagel, the league - they will create whatever profile and pretend to be real.

the key thing is use your gut feel and also your EQ/IQ - be smart. 

Good luck!

the guy whom intro me also keep hurrying me to transfer the funds. with sweet talks along the way.

Ladies/gentlman 

please be careful when you use online dating apps especially with the recent increasing number of china profile in dating apps. This kind of scam is called  in china. You guys can go baidu it and will have more horror scam stories. 

Please share with your family/peers/friends/relatives because you will never know if they are going to be the next victim-to-be. This can happened to female and male so just take note! 

These are the signs 

1. Their introduction/bio will be quite short or very sweet. E.g  that kind of bull shit. They will also state that they are in singapore for a short work trip or etc. 

2. They will put selfie in their profile so you kinda believe that they are ""real"". However, they aren't! They are cat fishing and probably take those pictures from online. 

3. Talk in wechat/telegram/whatsapp normally, after a while, they will ask you to talk in wechat/whatsapp/telegram. I guess it is easier for them to reply after all... They need to reply to 101 potential victims. 

4.they are sweet at talking and make you feel awwwww! 

5. Talk about finances/investment and show you their winnings. 
Sometimes, they will talk about finances/investment or what adults should be financially independent to have a better future. They will start to show you their winnings and tempt you to join them 

6. You don't need to transfer him money at all, just create an account 

7. The scammer will make you believe that you are earning and able to withdraw the earnings (i read from baidu) and put in more money and more money. Then one day ""puff"" they mia. 

After my incident happened, i tried to google online for this scam in singapore but i couldn't seem to find any cases. Back then, i didn't know that it is call  either so i did not read up more. 

I did told some of my friends and one of them (their friend friend friend - super distant) had this encounter as well. I believe there are some people who might have gotten scammed but did not voice up or don't know where to voice up. With the recent increasing china profile in dating apps, i really urged everyone to inform their loved ones and friends - not to fall for it! It is really sad to get scammed. With that, i hope everyone stay safe and becareful in both offline and online world!

                the caller called my mobile and said he was from singtel. he said that my home internet speed is slow due to unauthorised used of my home internet. he asked my to turn on my computer so that he could assist me. suspicious, i asked for his name which he refused. he offered to give me his employee id. then i asked him what my name is and he declined to disclose it as he said it was confidential. i said if he could not provide his proper singtel identity then how would i know if he was real. i continued to press him for his name, his phone and email so that i could call him back to verify. he said ""JOHN""...and then he hung up.

Never trust anyone who cannot properly identify themselves over the phone. a legitimate caller from the company would not hesitate to offer you their name and contact so that you can call them back to verify. even then, you should always be alert that they should be identifying you correctly. in case of doubt, always hang up and call back the organisation/company which is supposed to be the caller to verify.

stay safe!

Met a guy name Christopher Zhang on okc in april. After a few messages, he requested to move to whatsapp and will delete account on okc.
He said he moved from hong kong to scotland at 3 years old when his dad passed away. He now lives in Glasgow, work as a mechanical engineer and owns a small company. His Whatsapp number are +44 7475 902334 and +44 7395 346368 (business account) but he might have more than 2 numbers.
Every day, we would message. He said he loves me but he refused to do video calls. He said he would like to send me a present because he doesn’t know when this pandemic would be over so at least I could have a physical item that could remind me of him.
I already suspected that he is a scammer through his texts. Sometimes he would use American english and sometimes British english. So, I turned him down. He then got annoyed and I stopped messaging him.
He seems to appear in the following two stories:

I sent message to Lazada seller on chat about the detail of oneplus cellphone. He replied that he sent the detail to me by whatsapp, so i told him my whatsapp contact number. He requested me to do bank transfer for purchase and said that he did delivery and sent me the invoice receipt once i sent money. I didn't trust him, so i requested the evidence to trust him. He sent me a photo of a screen shot of the payment from other customer. I didn't trust him completely yet, but i transferred money. After a few hours, he said that received payment and would update delivery. He didn't contact me next day, so i asked him about the delivery and invoice receipt. He said that i had to pay the additional money for tax and insurance, then he refunded it when the delivery come. 

I have never heard about the additional fee, so I told him that i won't pay an more additional fees. He could refund me the money or send phone to me asap. He never sent the phone, invoice receipt and never refunded money.

He ended all contact with me after that.

                Tinder bitcoin scam

I have gotten matched with a few good looking Chinese national on Tinder, their profile pictures are usually of them living a jet-setter lifestyle. At times, their photos will have them posting with luxury cars. What are the odds that such successful ladies are doing on an App like Tinder?

They will come off strong, directing the conversation, they will ask about what kind of work you do which is a definite no in Asian culture, it is like asking how much money do you earn. They go on to mentioned they are into investment: Bitcoin. That they work with a certain bank researching into Bitcoin. How Bitcoins are the investment to go to because certain countries are investing in Bitcoin. Do take note of their grammar since I suspect that English isn’t their first language.

Red flags should start rising at these moments because Banks do not invest in Bitcoins. No countries are investing in Bitcoins. Whenever in doubt simply do a fact check on Google. I played dumb and played along with them and when I got tired of the conversation, I exposed them. Leading to them blocking me. 

What I have learnt later is that such scammers will lie blatantly, this is their filter system. To capture the vulnerable who will believe every single word they say. 

I do not know what happens if one says they are interested to invest in Bitcoins. I have a hunch they will direct you to some scam Bitcoin site for you to make payment.

I was contacted by a person named Trevor Chang on Facebook  in April 2020, he asked for my whatsapp number and he declared his feelings quite early on into our chats. 
He states that he is an Aircraft Maintenance Engineer with American Airlines and is based in Houston Texas. After texting he said that he was sending me a parcel of gifts, but to receive the parcel i had to pay the courier company SGD4000 via cash deposit only (with no invoice or any transcript), which i  refused to pay and he said he will settle the problem and send the parcel back to USA. 
We continued chatting via text and whatsapp calls for the next 6 weeks, when he told me that he was going to Malaysia to take on a freelance contract job for 1 month (from 22nd May to 27th June) to conduct a maintenance, installation and inspection of a jet engine. 
2 weeks into the job, he messaged me to ask me for $20,000 to buy some equipment he needs to finish the job on 1st June 2020. i refused and he was trying to use the guilt trip on me to send him money. 
I have only seen his face via video call for 2 secs on the night before he requested for the sum of money, to be sent to a Singapore savings account so that it can transferred to him. I refused to help him or take his calls after that. 
His English while was not bad, was not what you would expect from a graduate of a USA university but he did demonstrate some knowledge of the Areospace jargon.  

He is still active on Facebook and i have some of his pictures if you would like to have them as well. 
Thank you, hope you can use my experience to help others.

On 1st day of work, I realised there was money transferred to my acc. I was told to transfer that amount to another acc and after transferring, money still kept pouring in. I panicked and kept on transferring as I did not want to have anything to do with the cash. 
Many transactions were (unfortunately) made in a panic and eventually my bank acc and secondary linked acc got frozen. I have a made a police report since, and is waiting to be contacted.

I said, ""Hold on. Did you say you are from Singtel?"".

She said, ""yes, sir. now please go to your router and reset it for me"".

I said, ""how can you detect this issue when I am not even with singtel? i'm with a different service provider, which means, i am not on the singtel network.""

She explained that all these major Service providers are working collaboratively.

So i insisted that i don't have any problems with my internet so i don't think there is anything to fix. I will just change my router password later.

Then she threatened me that they will cut off my internet. So I told her to go ahead and do that then I hung up.

Met on slowly app, gave his whatsapp number. Says his name is chen anng and works as an engineer for exxonmobil. Was temporarily assigned in  los angeles, california. Slowly app has texas as his location. After the contract, he said he will return to his home country, singapore but kuala lumpur, malaysia will be his next stop first for company clearance.
Backstory: originally from singapore and parents passed away when he was still young. Was left under the care of a pastor. Deeply religious. Widower, wife died with the child during childbirth, was left with two children named betty and julie who are under the pastor's care and now at a boarding school in perak, malaysia. 
Happened on may 15,2020, professes his love early and promises marriage. After two weeks of texting and voice calls daily, have asked for help if can transfer fund for his kids' school needs thru the school principal since he can't do it on his job site due to some restrictions. Asked to transfer $3000, but when declined as i'm on a tight budget, just requested to transfer whatever amount i can. I still declined. The following morning he sent a screenshot of his flight booking to kuala lumpur through the site cheapoair.com but looks like booking confirmation is fake. Last contact was june 1, 2020, called from the airport with background noise and said he will contact me with a malaysia number as soon as he reaches kuala lumpur the next day. Have already blocked and reported this via whatsapp and also sent a report to ftc.gov.

The app looks more rundown, graphic is not as good (not sure why i fall for it). He will make you transfer money from huobi into this app.
So this person will tell you to start small and guide you together, you will earn money in the beginning. You should just go along, get the money and run out of it. 
Cause the next step he will ask you to put in more money to earn a bonus from the system. Once you do that, you are dead. Cause the system will tell you that your account got frozen and you need a sum of money to unfreeze it to get whatever money you have inside.
How do I know he is lying to me? Cause he wouldn't help me, someone who claimed to ""love you"" and has been investing for long and together with me, he should have the capital to help, but he refuses to help. He let you die on your own. Long story short, I got into another debt trying to get this money out and this guy will just leave you after.
The person may be using another person's photo because he refuses to video call no matter what - so make sure a person dare to do this, before you put in your money.
So his picture is different, but i will put down some of the contact numbers you may need to take note of.
 (customer service hotline for bambu app) - +852 5493 2511
 (that guy's name, might be fake) - +852 5615 1730

I received a phone call from my house number (no caller id, hence unable to provide the scammer's number) on 29 may 2020 around 1.30pm. The conversation goes like this:
Indian guy (scammer): hi good afternoon, i am calling from singtel and we were notified that somebody is tapping onto your house's wifi and this results in the slow wifi connection. In order to stop these hackers, may we check how many devices are currently connected to your internet?
Me: i dont understand what you're talking about.
Scammer: -repeats the above in a sarcasm tone, break down his speech and talks slowly-
Me: i have a couple of devices currently connected to my internet
Scammer: for example, mobile or laptop?
Me: yes i have a laptop
Scammer: ok, now we need you to use your laptop right now so we can direct you to remove these hackers from tapping onto your wifi
Me: -thinking that something is not right here-
Me: i think it's fine, my laptop is charging and i can't use my laptop while talking to you
Scammer: -continues his speech while i'm not even listening-
Me: -cuts in- actually i dont need to remove them from my wifi, i'll just change the password
Scammer: madam, i'm still talking 
(that's when i find this call very dubious because a customer care officer shouldn't be rude at all)
Me: i need you to prove your identity. Tell me your name and department
Scammer: i'm mike from technician department
Me: can you tell me the name of the person who signed this singtel contract?
Scammer: madam, i need you to use your laptop now so we can rectify the situation
Me: can you tell me the name of the person who signed this singtel contract? Or else i am unable to verify your identity
Scammer: madam, i understand your concern but you have to login to your laptop right now or else i cannot tell you the name.
Me: all right, i will call singtel hotline and verify if your identity is real.
And the scammer didn't respond to my last sentence at all so i hung up the call. Fortunately, i did not reveal my personal information to the scammer. Yes, it is true that recently i have experienced slower connection with singtel wifi but i feel that the scammers are taking advantage of the current situation to scam others.
By the way, i've clarified with singtel and they confirmed that this is a scam call and told me to report to anti-scam helpline. 

Please help to spread the message across especially to those elderlys who are not well-educated of cyber scams. Thank you.

                On 28.5.2020,  I received a phone call from +65 94943939. it played a recorded message claiming that I had an unclaimed package at Changi Airport. I was transferred to an operator claiming to be from DHL at Changi Airport. She asked me for a package tracking number.  When I informed her that I don't have a tracking number and they were the ones that called me, she immediately hung up on me. I think It's pretty clear that the callers are targeting DHL customers. Since I haven't used DHL for a while and didn't have a tracking number, the callers were not able to take advantage of the situation. I have read of other similar scams on the scam alert website, some more serious where they transfer you to phone numbers in China claiming to be the Chinese police Force. Please stay alert everyone!

I was a victim of an internet love scam. It was a tormenting experience for me and it took me a year to forgive but not to forget. I study the characteristics of such scammers and all have similarities in their operandi modus.
Level 1) befriend you with 'hi', 'hello' , earn your trust, get quick intel on your background like marital status, family, whether you are staying alone, occupation to gauge your income
Level 2) romancing starts with dear, honey, sweetie, cutie, etc. Often romantic pictures, even sentimental music as props too !!
Level 3) money issues often begin with a luxury gift box with hidden money stuck in malaysia, need to pay clearance taxes in us$, emergency medical/surgery expenses, machinery repairs, lost wallet ... The mind game begins.
Level 4) hound you desperately, pitiful pleads etc . Angry phone calls to pressure...
They work in a team with different roles as the 'lover', logistics, government officer, bank officer like a well scripted drama. They can fake everything - instagram profiles, facebook, logistics websites, crytocurrency website, documentations.
My advice - don't believe. Block immediately and get out of social media for a while to calm your mind. If possible, screenshots, record conversations. Go to our friendly police station if harassed. Don't stay quiet and suffer in silence !! 

It's even better if you can identify the scam before it hurts you!

Kept mentioning that he was interested in me despite me continuously mentioning that i'm in a relationship. Said that he was in the Netherlands and bought 20kg worth of gifts and when he posted it over, said he put in $20,000 to help offset the clearance fee into Singapore

A lady named “Siti” from a ""shipping company"" called fast shipping delivery texted me saying a parcel arrived addressed to me and had be pay sgd$20,000 for it to be sent over.

I denied knowing the sender and a few minutes later, Minsuh Jae angrily texted back asking why it was rejected and to have it sent back or I'll have to deal with the consequences.

                I received a call at 12 noon from an overseas number, the guy had a very heavy indian accent and said he was from singtel. 

Because the number was suspicious, i started googling while i was on the phone and did not pay attention to what he was saying but it was something about my internet connection, that there were many people trying to connect to my internet.

i asked him, ""you are calling from singtel right? why is your number a foreign number?"" he said,"" because i am using an internet phone."" 

but i was still suspicious and i went to my brother's room to ask him. meanwhile the indian guy asked me to check how my modem to see how many lights are on. my brother was convinced it's a scam and asked me to hang up which i did.

after that i read up on the scams and found a similar story where the victim was asked to check the number of lights on the modem. i also tried to chat with the singtel chatbot to see if anyone really called me but i was directed to their faq. it is said that singtel staff will not make unsolicited calls to check on your internet connection. so, please hang up if you receive such suspicious calls!

AFTER THAT STILL NEED BANK IN $4500 TO REFUNDS CHARGE.

At this point I refused and said I don't have money. He keeps on pushing to make me agree but I denied. I said I want to cxl the loan since I didn't receive any money just cxl the loan. In their pdf agreement stated 15% from loan amount apply need to pay which is 13500. So I told him that since I already bankin $8700 then just take it as cxl fee. 
I still refused AND TELL HE I DON'T HAVE EXTRA MONEY, the guy said he will wait until 12AM for my confirmation. After that I never reply his msg.

At 2.08pm on 26 May 2020 Tuesday, I received an email to my personal email (Junk folder) with my full name in the subject title. I opened it and read the entire email as it had all my details. I was very shocked and almost believed it as my full name, mobile number, date of birth, and address were stated in the beginning of the email. These details are all accurate/current. 
Because I share the same last name as this 'barrister' as well as have some relatives in Malaysia, I first thought the email to be true. However, the tsunami disaster in December 26, 2004 seemed like such a long time ago for any inheritance matter to occur. I knew it was a scam when he said that ""we would share the percentage on a mutually agreed-upon 60% for me and 40% to your kind self"" which seemed like an unfair percentage. 
I am worried because if this scammer managed to get my personal information, other people/scammers out there may have gotten my information. Thankfully, the NRIC field is left blank which meant that the scammer may not have this piece of information which is the most crucial. No money was lost except my personal information (which I did not give my consent in giving away this piece of information, the scammer had it already). 
I showed my daughter this scam email, she did some research and found someone who has reported this email as fraud several years ago and she later advised me to share my story on this page.

It didn't come across as a scam immediately until he asked me to download anydesk.com to give him access to my computer so that he can help me solve the issue quickly. 

It was at this point that i realised that it was a scam and started asking for proof that he was indeed a staff from Singtel. He started to faltering and I hung up.

                I reeived an SMS offering loans, got attracted to it and contact the number for enquiry. The process carry on in WhatsApp chat. I was asked to give snap shot of my WP, prove of Address and bank acc to received the loan. 

Day 2, I received msg from the same guy and said admin will call me. Short after, another guy call me and said I need to bankin 1900 to activate the loan acc, then only I will receive my loan amount which is 10k with monthly installment 190x5yrs. After I banking $1900,short after, I received msg saying I still need to bankin another 1900 for acc 2 activation. At this point I refused and said I don't have money. He keeps on pushing to make me agree but I denied. I said I want to cxl the loan since I didn't receive any money just cxl the loan. In their pdf agreement stated 15% from loan amount apply need to pay which is 1500. So I told him that since I already bankin 1900 then just take it as cxl fee. He then said its against company policy and said after I pay 1500 then only they will return my 1900. I still refused, the guy even said he will wait until 11pm for my confirmation. After that I never reply his msg. 

Day 3 morning I make police report about the scam. Police told me not to reply and msg and block those numbers. I still received msg treathening they will ask loan shark to come to my unit to throw paint. 

Just don't respond to advertisements offering loans as they are either from scammers or worse yet, loansharks!

                Story is the same as those submitted here. This person contacted me on Instagram and told me he had lost his parents since young and that he's working at hunt oil and gas company. 

Told me that he loved me and wanted to marry me. Sent me a luxurious parcel via fastwestcourier.com and the company kept asking me for money to get the parcel. They started by saying that the weight of the parcel was heavy, asked for money, then because they found money in the parcel, I need to purchase a declaration certificate of $21.2k sgd and then to pay a fine of $42.6k.

Received a call at 11.07am. An automated voice call saying that they were from singapore high court, asked me to press 9 for further inquiry.
After press 9, a lady picks up the call and did not address her name mentioned she was from singapore high court which she immediately asked for my name and ic number. 
I know THIs is a scam call after looking at the number. Singapore high court doesn't make such calls at all. Instead, they will send a mail letter directly to your house. I told her since when did singapre high court call people and asked for names. IMMEDIATELY the caller ended the call. I tried calling the same number, but the line was engaged.  

I called the police hotline to inform them about this scam call from Singapore high court. Singapore high court called themselves as supreme high court. Do take note of this scam calls out there. Stay safe.

                Here to warn everyone not to google and search for loan company. I faced this situation upon finding a loan therefore checking for interest rates .. I came across http://apcredi?-sg.com this website look so true till i am stupid enuff to provide all my details to them, Couple of calls was make thru wadsapp.  They are from malaysia, name jack, zack, jason, Darren. Keep changing names...Mentioning just a record to check for interest rates percent that i am able to get. 

I trusted them.. They have all my details.. As they are doing the same way wad bank is doing. Next they came to my house slipping in a a4 size paper stating ap credit and a guy name jack. He send my house area and blk pic to me and mention that to settle this. Pay him 300 dollars, i refuse stating i did not loan any money from them y do i have to pay them?

Then they got frustrated saying due to my bad attitude they will ask for 1k,
Moneylender asked us to pay them 3k to settle this or else our debt will snowball to 30k. It's so outrageous so I went to the police to log a report. They mentioned  just ignore. But my family is staying with me.. Wad do u mean by ignore? They sent videos and screen shots of house burning and video on a guy got beaten up cause of owning money. The threatening stopped. For a month. 

On the 21st May, it started again with me receiving a call from another number again. Upon picking up, he said my apartment was put up for sale on property guru. On the 21st may at about 2 plus my husband mentioned two persons were loitering around our house - a young boi and a lady at the age about 20plus.

They attached 2 photos of transactions of $300 money to my bank account. Wait a min. I did not provide my bank account to him. How did they get hold of my bank account? And he mention in the wadsapp that to settle this pay them 700. I went to the police again. I feel upset, frustrated and crossed, y did i land myself into this shit. All I did was to check on the interest RATES. I did not loan any amount from them only check for interest rate.

I pressed ""9"". Then i waited for a few rings then a guy in english answered me. ""singapore high court how can i help"".

I asked him that this call is regarding what? He told me that he is calling from SINGAPORE high court and there is urgent summon for me and asked me to give the reference number (if any). I said i don't have any and wondering how come i am getting a direct call, they usually don't call like this. i asked their contact details so that i can call them for further clarification and Then he dropped the call.

I tried calling back the number (m1) from my mobile and landline, after 3-4 tries i could connect to a lady via my landline number. she told me me that she is in qatar and number is in roaming mode and she is completely unaware of this call.

the guy's accent was not very clear and WASN'T very fluent in english. he did not sounded of singaporean or south asian accent.The lady, however, had a south asian accent and pretty fluent in english.

                A india lady with thick Indian accent called me at 11am to say that she's from SingTel technical department and they detected abnormal behaviours from my network and asked me if I have laptop besides me to verify. By knowing my laptop is a Macbook and she passed me to another Indian guy. The guy asked me to open my Terminal and key-in ""netstat"", asked me how many foreign addresses in the results and explained to me which addresses are abnormal and has been established on my network. Because of this, I really believe they are from Singtel at the point of time. 

After that, they asked me to download and install the app called ""Teamviewer"" and provide my id and password to them. He even asked me to use the website called “validator” to validate if my email account and bank account has been hackled. I still not aware its scam. The guy told me they will upgrade my security level but it takes 1 more hour. In between he asked me what websites I’m frequently using recently, like ibanking or online shopping.  Knowing that they are assessing my desktop and able to see everything of my computer, I felt like something was wrong so I disconnected the remote assess and questioned him if he can prove me he’s the Singtel employee and send my personal email immediately using his Singtel employee email. He gave me a number 8004922429 and his employee number. I searched the odd number immediately, found out the information from Scamalert. The case of scam has been confirmed. I’m not sure how much of my personal information has lost. 

Don't be the next victim so beware!

                On 20 May 2020, a ""Jennifer"" claiming to be from StarHub called my home line and advised that suspicious activities on my wifi have been observed for the past few days. Some unauthorised devices could have been hacking into my wi-fi. She said they can offer assistance after I have done some verification of devices connected to my wifi. When I requested to verify her identity, she stated that I could verify by comparing the information that she would offer after I have

(1)  Checked the number of blinking lights on my router;
(2) pressed the ""Windows"" and ""R"" keys on my connected laptop.

Finding her evasive, I refused to follow her instructions, and told her to call me back one hour later as I was about to start a work meeting.

Thereafter, I contacted StarHub Customer Service to verify ""Jennifer's"" claims. StarHub confirmed that it was a scam. StarHub will not request customers to touch our laptop keys.

                1. I received a call from +65 65071766 on my Handphone,

2. in the afternoon of 20 may '20, about 1.50pm.


The caller claimed to be from singtel and first asked about the quality of (specifically) singtel's internet service over the past few days at home. i mentioned it was fine, and he proceeded to claim that there were alleged hacking attempts done through my telecomm isp.


caller spoke in english with unmistakable indian accent, and there was traffic noise in the background, making me suspect that the call seems to be made from india or bangladesh, from an internet cafe. this deeply concerned me as the call number i picked up was with a +65 local extension.


caller requested for me to turn on computer and verify with him the computer id. i challenged him suggesting that he gave me my i.p. address and computer i.d. since he was from singtel, and as a service provider he should know. he was also unable to provide any proof that he is a singtel operative.


i became annoyed and told him off - if he was the service provider, and there is possible hacking activity through the internet service, shouldn't he be the one solving the problem? with that the caller hung up abruptly.


3) besides a lost of precious time and being victim to nuisance calling, i would like to share this story as it was alarming that the scam call was through a local land-line. this incident has made me more suspicious of local extension calls, as my past encounters with scam calls had international extensions, which i promptly ignored.

                Received a call from a man, with a heavy indian accent, claiming to be from singtel.

The man first asked if you have experienced slow internet connection. then he said that singtel has detected heavy usage on the connection and would like to perform a technical check.

he asked me to go to the router to check if the lights are blinking, then asked how many devices are connected.

then he asked me to go to a laptop to do a network connection test. he also said that all the actions will be performed by me hence they will have no access to my laptop.

when i asked him to verify that he is from singtel, he would ask you to have pen and paper ready to take down the information, then he gave the following information : Name = Stewart john; staff id=stls1059; tel=1800809651; customer ID number (long string of numbers and alphabets);  after giving these information, he would assure that this is not a scam and that is why he is able to give so much information. then he said that I can check the information later as i have written it down. after this, he asked me to hold on and my call would be transferred to a higher technician. 

when I asked to call back to continue, that is when the line was cut-off. 

the scammers are nasty, they would ask questions as if they are trouble-shooting but in actual fact try to find out more information about your connection and devices available to perform the scam. they would also give you a lot of information to lead you into thinking that they are legitimate and ask you to write it down, as they know that since it was written down, we will be ok to proceed and some may not bother to check further.

I received a msg thru my number regarding loan promotions, i was attracted by it and decided to contact a person named ricky thru whatsapp and enquire abt the loan. I applied for a 20k loan and thereafter gave ricky my income statements a photo of my nric and my next of kin details and my bank acc number. After a few hrs, ricky called me thru whatsapp to inform me that the loan has been approved. He then told me that his company will transfer me a sum of $300 and after a wk i had to return $500, this is to test whether i have the ability to pay back the loan on time a.k.a trial loan. 

I returned the $500 5 days (on 12 ma), to a posb sav acc stated in the details, however, Ricky told me that i had made a wrong transfer as i did not indicate “ricky clear” as the reference name, he then requested me to transfer another $500 to the same bank acc, and he also told me that the $500 i had paid extra would be credited back to me tgt with the 20k loan after i sign the agreement. I did as he told me and transferred a sum of $500 to him, thereafter, he explained to me that there is an admin fee that i had to pay before i could get the loan, this admin fee is 10% of the loan amt, which is $2000, however, i explained to him that i didnt had enough money and could only fork out $1100, he said he would help me think of ways to help me temporarily pay the remaining $900 of admin fee, after that he msg me and told me that he managed to lend $900 from his wife, and wanted me to pay the $1100 from my acc, while he pay $900 for me, he told me not to tell anyone as helping clients to pay funds is illegal, and also told me to return him immediately after i get the loan. 

The next day, he told me that his manager found out about the funds and questioned him, and also confiscated the funds until i could fork out the remaining $900. I took around 5 days to raise the $900 and transferred him, he also promised me that there would not be anymore issues. However, the next day, he messaged me again to say that the funds could not be drawn out as it is under a red column. 

Knowin that something was wrong, I called the police after that.

I questioned him where was he calling from as he addressed me not by my real name but by my nickname in my Facebook account. He then repeated himself agent so and so from iras.


Through the phone I could hear the environment that seemed to be outdoors with road noise. It was really suspicious for iras to refund me and for him to call me not from an office!

It all started from an IG message (antony_lee23) and he claimed to be working in Edinburgh oil industry and he has Singaporean-Korean origins. We chatted on whatsapp and he always texted me in the morning and night every day without fail. Days later, he started to tell me that he has feelings for me and will send me loving messages. He then insisted to send me some gifts in appreciation for me and I rejected him initially but he pushed on until I gave him my address. 4 days later, a man from the ‘courier company’ (+65 8682 5805) texted me via whatsapp that my package has arrived in Singapore and I need to pay SGD3,600 to clear custom charges before they can deliver the package and I need to pay it asap within a few hours before delivery insurance expires. I checked with Antony and he played mind games about being upset if I were to reject his gift. When the courier company provided an account number with personal name instead of company name (POSB Bank Acct Name: Shah Nizam; Acct No: ??83 6385), and refused to provide any picture of customs’ statements requesting for the duty fees, it got really fishy. The man on the phone sounded French but with a Malay name? 

Thankfully I found this website and read about many similar scams. So I immediately blocked the two contacts and avoided paying for anything. Hope this story helps to prevent others from being scammed too.

A guy called me to say that he is from starhub and they have detected abnormal behaviour from a third party hack in my internet which was cause security problem and also the connection slow down. My internet was indeed slow & sometime not able to connect .then he asked me to check my router by using my computer to run an application, while he was asking me to type in a command to execute a program & give him security code. 

I told him why i must give secuirty code and what is no evidence to prove he was from Starhub. I told him i will call 1633 to double confirm but he stop me and claimed that the security issue only settle by their dept. After that he gave me very odd number 8004922429 to call & hang up. 

When i called the number he gave , the person who pick up the call also the same guy. So i called Starhub to check my internet and the by technical support officer, there wasn't any security issues and that's when I found out that it was a scam. 

If i continued to run the program, he would have hacked into my computer and stole my personal information.

I was looking for a personal loan online. I was unfortunately landed on a scammer google ad which misrepresent a licensed moneylender. This scammer texted me requesting for my nric, 15 mths cpf statements, latest payslips and nok particulars. I was scammed a total of $32k as their ""processing fee"". The whole incident was very traumatising. Scammers will misrepresent those licensed moneylender and usually will use numbers which cannot call through.

Upon finding out that we are with Starhub, the lady tried to explain that Starhub uses SingTel's network and hence she is contacting us instead of Starhub. The 2nd call ended quickly as the guy hung up immediately when I asked for his number to call him back.

                This happened during the m1 broadband outage on 12 may 2020. A lady posing as singtel staff called my family member claiming to be checking on the pretext that the infrastructure is managed by Singtel (broadband account is under my name), and that our broadband may have been compromised by hackers. they asked my family member to install teamviewer and log in using their account.

The phone was passed to me and they started to ask about whether i did internet banking. They then informed another technical staff will call me for further checks. Another guy with an indian accent then called back my family member's hp using an unknown number. After getting me to me to run msconfig he took remote control of the laptop. I did not grant them remote access so i started getting concerned.the laptop screen blanked out several times so i am not sure what they might have done. I requested to verify their number and identity. That was when he ended the call.

First i thought he was genuine (having sg no +6597461422 & mal no +60168764238). Started to trust him & i felt i had a nice connection, looking fwd for him to come back to sg. 

But i started to notice he replied in wee hours like 1 or 2 am. In the end my 'suspicion' came true - he asked for help, he cannot pay his transfer tax (for work) as his account got problem & he needs to verify in person in sg while he is right now in kl - asked me to send $4400 to asimah binet kemat (maybank 14190602253) - i realize he's just a scammer. I called him too - he sounded like an african guy. I did image research - he used pictures of a south korean plastic surgeon.

Received a watsapp message / call from this guy call paul oh. He was very persistent in pushing the loan to me and having the need for money, I agreed and the scam starts.
He said that in order to get the loan, applicants need to agree with a bank test loan i.e. They will send a sum of money and in agreement, you need to send back the amount agreed e.g. They send 200 and we need to return $380 i.e. $180 for them. Additionally, they promised to return the 100 immediately after we send them.
When I asked him to remit the 100, he got pissed and immediately block me and the so called finance dept of his blocked me too.
In total, i lost 180 from this scammer. The finance department no is 90767141.
Hope this incident does not happen to any of netizens here and hope to have this scum bags arrested.

                IT ALL STARTED FROM MATCHING THIS PERSON (DAVID LEE +44 7392364853) FROM TINDER, HE claimed that he is a Chinese-born in UK, and works with ship engine repairs. He shared one day that his ship will be landing in Poland and asked for my details (name, address, clothes size, shoes size) and mentioned that he is gonna get me something from Poland and shipped to me. 

I rejected in the first place, but he insisted so i gave him the details. later that day he send me the detail of the website with tracking number, www.airtrustservices.com (bet the website is also fake). after 4 days the tracking details showed the package reached singapore. one day before the package showed arrive, david lee said that he stuffed some cash in the package for me to pay for the charges. the next day, someone claimed he is mr.karl from air trust service courier (+65 86970175) and told me the package has reached singapore and ready to be delivered to my address. after we arrange the delivery time, he proceed to tell me that i have to pay for local charges and import duty tax sgd3500. then i asked for invoice, he say after payment made invoice will be send together with the package, and provided the bank details GANESH SHARMA KRIS??? STATE BANK OF INDIA SINGAPORE ??24-0110-5101-00. 

I started doubting why the account details is not from the shipping company, he said the account details belong to the secretary in charge today. so i ignored him, he start to pester me with the payment or else government will confiscate the package until i threaten to report to the police.

                Just sharing my personal experience on the people who i talked to on social networking sites.

By going through the stories posted by the victims in this site, i noticed there are some similiar signs of warning which i experienced.

1. attractive photos - This is the first magnet that lured me into engaging a conversation with them. i even did a reverse image search on the photos but it return zero results. 
2. self-Proclaimed millionaire - Claimed that he owns a factory in osaka, showing pictures that he is driving a porsche. In my two encounters, they are very wealthy in their early 30s.

3. where are they - interestingly enough, they are never near to me. they are either in guangzhou or in osaka.

4. language preference - not being racist here, most of them are chinese. they are more comfortable to converse in chinese. but in my recent encounter, he is quite fluent in english. 

5. touching stories - about how poor he was in the past and able to make a name for himself as the boss of a company. for the other guy, he is a divorce, claimed that his wife cheated on him.

6. investment methods - seems like they very into crypto currencies. they claimed that they have uncles abroad who knows the market very well and posted screenshots of their earnings. in my first encounter, he was very pushy to get me to buy some bitcoins and play some game in a chinese website.

hope this helps.

                Dear friends, 

You can make friends in the social media, not all are bad people. I have good friends via FB in overseas.

Bear this in mind, no matter how good a relationship with a friend either man or woman, once they talk about facing in some problems start to beware, it is going to be money problem. Once they talk about how much they earn from Crypto, Forex, is going to be a lured into investment.

First I will do a picture image search on google. If his or her face appear in many other social media with different names, it is likely a scammer using other people's profile.

#Beware these peoples:-

1) If you are ask to go into hangout to chat
2) If they video call you but you couldn't see them clearly and cut off within seconds
3) They can't call you at all due to certain security they are facing
4) They will ask their children to chat with you to gain your trust
5) They can't use video call at all due to the types of phone they are using
6) He or she will tell you, love you to the moon and back
7) Show you the investment account with lots of money
8) Ask you to donate for charity and help the present covid situation
9) And all of them are very rich with status like Doctor, Engineer, Self Employed
10) Write beautiful messages that makes you happy everyday
11) Send pictures of their house, rooms, parents, children etc
12) Send you compromising photos of themselves
13) Normally they text you as Dear, Darling, Honey, Babe, Dearie, Sweetheart etc to please you


#Beware when they ask you for this:-

1) Buy a Birthday cake for them - it can cost up to a few thousands SGD
2) Buy a handphone for them as they are at high seas and hand phone dropped into the sea
3) Help them as they are stranded in another country and need some cash and will pay you back double 
4) Children are very sick and need to see a doctor and they are stranded in the military base
5) Help as a applicant to apply for leave vacation and you pay for their air ticket
6) Ask for your account as they wanted to transfer the charity donation to put into your account
7) Some will ask you to go to a Singapore Company as they had few hundred thousands there and ask you to help take for them but first of all you need to pay a transaction fees.

I had met all of the above. I chat with them and observe the types of scam and method used so that I wish to warn all my fellow friends. 
 
And I waited for them to to give me their recipient bank account. I will not do any transfer. 

I do wish I have a way to report them but it seemed not able to catch them as they are overseas. At last what I do is to block them.

Bear in mind that once the money is transferred, chances of you getting it back is near zero.

Kelvin liqiang approached me via instagram in early of april 2020.he told me he was born in beijing and grew up in uk with his uncle after he lost his parent when he was 4 years old. He also shared that he is currently working in raytell electrical co. Limited, uk as an electrical engineering. His words were coated with honey and texted me day and night and wanted to fly over to singapore after the covid-19 situation after knowing our common interests and others.
This was how the story began, he shared that raytell was giving out a contract to the outstanding staff to reward the hardwork of the staff. He won the reward and the contents of contract were to built a new hospital in bulgaria. He snapped a picture to proof the contract. Before going to bulgaria, he went to the bank to pledge his collateral to get a loan to buy equipment's and tools for the project. ..due to the closure of airport in bulgaria, he flew over to bulgaria by private jet of the bulgarian government.. Then, he informed me that he couldn't clear the equipment's and tools due to the speciality tax and custom fees in bulgaria. He even told that his lawyer had forked out some money to help him. I told him to borrow from his colleagues who were on the same trip. I even proposed him to call his bank to allow him to extend the loan to him and necessary verification steps to be done by the bank. Every suggestions i gave seemed no possible for him and needed me transfer money to help him. He gave me the united oversea bank account number : 9281330434 and the name of the bank account holder was soh ai lin which he claimed that she was an agent from bulgarian custom.
After the transferred on 24 april 2020, i asked for the evidence on the custom fees as he asked for another usd3,000 to move his tools and equipment from custom to the site via a private truck.he was able to provide the document issued by the bulgarian government. So, i planned to help him with the transportation fees.
After much discussion with the bank officer, he warned me it was a love scam and he also explained to me how to verify the documents.

                I was scammed for $5000 on 2 separate payments. I was informed that I would be receiving a gift from Poland by a friend I met online, Mr Ahmed Ibrahim, claiming he grew up in London. His address is Zwirki Wigury, 00-00, Warsaw Poland

According to him, the payment need to be settled by recipient and he, the sender, informed me that he had included the delivery payment in USD dollars to cover the cost of shipping. He said I can use the money to settle the delivery charges and buy some clothes for myself. In the box he sent, he claimed there would be a surprise for me, showing pictures via whatsapp of 2 ladies bag, a necklace and rolex watch set. I did not ask him to do all this, he went and did it on his own.

I have a sense that the two parties involved, among others, were the same person. One was a so-called friend, Ahmed Ibrahim, charming me to like him. The other claimed to be the international courier representative, contact number +6018-4039782. I noticed both made similar spelling mistakes and they will take turns being busy and uncontactable. Mr Ahmed was also observed to be too calm about this matter.

The first payment of $1500 was made yesterday 29 April 2020 via DBS online banking to Maybank account number ???218662931 Hasima binti mohd said. I was suspicious when they refused cash payment even when I asked to. I believe it is an international syndicate that involves several people in other countries. I had also noticed that the sender's social media account on Facebook suddenly disappeared later in the evening. When asked, the sender replied he deactivated the account.

The second payment of $3500 was made today 30 April 2020 via DBS online banking to bank DBS Singapore Lim Tjie Wie account number ???-017869-0. I almost borrowed money from a licensed moneylender to settle this amount. I am grateful as the staff informed me that this was a scam and to report to the police. 

After blocking all contacts, i saw a man lurking outside our home corridor. Pretended to walk pass our door slowly, paused in front of our door then continued walking then changed his mind when he saw the camera, turned around and walk pass our house again.

                I responded to a loan Sms & visited the website http://www.1133moneylender.com/ 

From the website I click on the whatsapp number and was directed to contact with their loan agent Gavin & according to their website their office is located in raffles City builDing.


They cLaimed to be related to the actual Moneylender company 1133moNey lender at BAlestier.


He ask me for my details, the standard loan procedures: NRIC, payslip, 6mths CPF statement & send across a video of me holding my NRIC.


I have requested for loan of S$50,000 and monthly payment $950 x 60mths.


he told me that he will be transferring $500 into my account, as their company practice, which I will need to transfer $800 back to them once my application is approved and the extra $300 will be deducted from my first installment.


The next day he told me that the loan has been approved and I can transfer the $800 back to him, After I transfer $800 to the account his gave me (POSB ???-09813-3), he told me that I make an error in my transfer comment which I didn't indicate as “GAVIN CLEAR”.


As such their system unable to match my transfer, thus need to redo the $800 transfer to another account (UOB ???-384-0571) indicating “Gavin clear”


After the transferred he called me saying that my name is flagged as red name in their system due to my first error transfer, there he ask me for another transfer of $2750 for the red name removal.


Both the $800 and $2750 will be reimbursed to me together with my loan when we meet up to sign the loan contract.


After I transfer another $2750 to (UOB ???-384-0571), he called me again saying that there should be another $2750 transfer for them to reactivate my loan account.


This is when I'm beginning to sense that i might have be scammed.


I have requested to speak to his accountant, which another guy by the name of Jeffery called me and give me the same story.


After this i called my bank to seek for help in cancelling the transfer, however bank told me that a police report need to be make & shared with the bank.

The scammer sells ps4 pro new at cheap prices at below 400. He will ask you to whatsapp him to ""deal"". He will ask you to transfer 50% and the rest will be cash on delivery. He will provide you a local bank account number and someone else's identity card. After you have done the transfer, he will ask you for the full price to continue the transaction. If you decline, he will never contact you again.

                Scammer told me to promote his product and suddenly, my account got blocked on carousell. I thought the money was too good to be true but true enough, I got scammed. I thought I could earn some income during the cb period but guess not. found the job on Facebook and I will never do this kind of job ever again. before account was blocked, a seller was interested in buying. I guess my account got blocked due to that as he might have been cheated by the scammer.

Editor's Note: Please do not trade on behalf of others as you might end up dealing with disgruntled customers when the person who ""hired"" you turned out to be a scammer. Also, it's against Carousell guidelines to trade on behalf of others.

He claImed to be a petrol chemical engineer currently posted to Kuwait for a contract. asked for money for his equipments and work tools. Subsequently asked for more money to open a bank account as he inHerited his dead mother’s money and need an account with the fake bank he created to gain access to the funds. He promised that he would pay back everything one he got the funds but disappeared after money was transferred. There was even a fake bank manager communicated with me via email and scammed me.

Today i received a text demanding me to pay up $450 by a certain time but with the advise by the IO and friends, i did not transfer. i hope there will be no harassment or so. but i am ready for the worst. please please do not trust this kind of people. and to debtors its not worth it to do this, just go and make a police report and save yourself.

Knew this person named davis liu from cmb and he claimed that he is a Chinese-American working in kuwait for a contract job. Sweet talker and a very convincing person. Asked for usd$3000 to pay for his work tools as he had no access to his us bank account while in kuwait. Subsequently asked me to loan s$10000 to help him with a crisis at work related for failure in machinery. Said he will be stuck in kuwait if he doesn't finish his contract promised he would pay once he is done. 
Months later, he asked for usd$5000 to open a bank account as he inherited his mum’s money as she passed away due to car accident. Said the money can be transferred from his mums account to his when he opens this new account. Said he’ll pay me everyt once he has access to thhose funds. Then so-called bank manager named daniel edwards from rbc (a fake email given and fake account manager) said he required cash on transaction usd$3000 to transfer davis mum’s fund into davis account. He said that if i don’t pay this amount then I couldn’t get back all my money asap as this is the only problem left. After paying, he disappeared. I notified the banks and police immediately

Trk#: r690382803147 please resolve the issue here: 6ak.us/vbhf?"". I sent a tracked package out earlier in the afternoon via singpost so i clicked on the link. It directed me to a page that looked like Singpost's website, and asked me to make payment of about $1.67. I filled in my personal information on the first page (name, contact number, email and address) and when i clicked to the second page for payment, the page looked suspicious as it wasn't the usual payment page i saw while shopping online. It looked like a page from a foreign bank, which i wouldn't expect singpost to use. I immediately stopped and went back to the first page of the link, and clicked on the singpost logo at the top of the screen to reload. It didn't bring me back to the singpost homepage, but instead tried to load a different page. 

I went to the official Singpost website and found out that there were phishing scams recently regarding this, so I called the customer service hotline and verified that it was a scam.

I invested S$1000 and S$2000 respectively and managed to get my cash back. On the third try, the service provider of the app told me that i have to meet cash limit of $50,000 before i can withdraw my cash. After meeting the cash limit, the service provider said i need to top up to $100,000. 

I ran out of cash and davie said i need to borrow from banks, if not both of us will lose all our funds as our accounts are linked. He preyed on VICTIM's goodwill and compassion too. In total, i LOSt 140000sgd.

He claimed that their system received multiple illegal devices connected to my internet. he asked me for the number of users whom I'm sharing my wifi with (I did not disclose this and said I can't remember). He then asked me to check and remove the permission of unauthorised devices that are connected to my network.

Before he provide me with step-by-step instructions that involve going to a particular website, I told him that my laptop is not with me right now and I will contact singtel again when I have it back. He told me that he can only resolve this issue if i provide him live update while visiting the website he advised. Since I am unable to surf net now, he will call me back later (sort of discouraged me from contacting singtel from my end)

                I talked to this girl on LIne which I found her from Tinder. initially it was going smoothly, then she offered the services because she was a student doing part time job, needed some money, etc. So I went with it. upon meeting at the location, she said her “friend"" will contact me to arrange the meetup. Then he told me to pay S$300 at the AXS machine via alipay top-up. AFter that he asked for more, giving other excuses. I felt fishy after paying 3k. I wanted to stop but he sort of threaten me. Once I've left the vicinity, the girl contacted me and then showed gruesome video of they threatening. In the end I was too gullible and pay another 5k worth of google playstore card.  Unfortunately, I can't write much as I'm limit to 500 words. I can go all day long and list every details of how they scam and what kind of excuses given. I found out that the girls are around HK and they somehow manage to spoof their location in Singapore. Don't trust any girls providing LINE ID in dating apps. (eg, tinder, CMB, etc).

Editor's Note: Police have shared that at least S$295,000 was lost to credit-for-sex scams in March this year, with about 112 reports lodged. We advised MOPs to be wary of such scams during this Covid-19 period as scammers are not taking a break during this period. 

Also, a gentle reminder that members of the public are to stay home and avoid going out during the “circuit breaker” period.

He asked me to transfer $2.3k to him so that he can asked his lawyer to help me settle.  I refused, he called me again kept pushing me to transfer the $2.3k or $3K to cancel the loan.  I told him i have no monies left as I have up till then transferred $10.8k to him.
he then mentioned that he might have to refer my case to the lawyer.  i told him by all means refer and i shall wait for the lawyer letter then. 

upon hearing that, he then said it is not advisable, just transfer the $2.3k to close the case.  i refused.  i have also tried called the 3 numbers but all cannot get thru.

I have since made a police report.

beware of these 3 numbers (91940461, 83693320 n 90440424)

An ""officer from ISD"" got in touch with me to purchase my invention. I was told that there was a contract to be signed with ISD. 
I paid a stamp duty tax of 0.3% but didn’t manage to get the contract. ""ISD CFO"" requested that I make the contract and pay stamp duty again and assured me that everything will be fine. I paid again and did not receive money for the contract.
Because of your ""ISD CFO"", I lost about $ 85,000 somewhere.

                I received an SMS saying that i have a parcel pending delivery until s$2.95 is paid. 

I happen to also have a parcel on its way. So, i clicked on the link which lead me to The ‘singpost webpage’. It showed that the parcel was still at the distribution centre. 

So, i paid using my credit card. Few days later, i received a bank notification saying that a transaction of s$104.95 was made to dpbill.net. I contacted the bank and they said that it was a scam from denmark. I went to the police station to make the report. 

I hope nobody falls for this scam.

                Found their website and contact them
1) Asking for $475 for initial 1st month loan payment that been transfered to ocbc acct on 6th april
2) Asking for $350 as there are issue to disburse my loan but will rebate back together with loan amount. I have transferred amount to POSB acct on 7th april

3) they claimed to have received an email from mas saying that they cant disburse the money as there are requirement of itf (immediate transfer fees) of $500 before the loan can be release., Told them i don't have the money and ask for refund. Claimed it takes 10-14 days for the refund.

4) when ask for the refund, they are asking for the cancellation fees for the loan package of $280.

Lesson learnt:  I have lost $825 due to this. I wish them no harm , and hope there wont be others like me as time are quite bad right now with covid-19. Should help people who are in need but not doing this kind of scamming. Believe in karma.

I press ""9"". Then i waited for a few rings then a guy SPOKE IN english AND SAY. ""singapore high court how can i help"".

I told him i received a call as per the voice message and was lead here,  he ask me to provide my full name and nric number. At that time, which i provided unknowingly, (Grave mistake) as i just got up of bed.

He later told me that i was to attend a court hearing on the 27th of april for a criminal case of money laundering. HE First ASKED IF I RECEIVED ANY CALL PREVIOUSLY AS THEY HAVE CALLED ME TWICE BEFORE ON THE 16TH AND 20TH OF APRIL, I SAID NO.

i was very curious, thus i asked further and he asked if i know anyone by the name of loh mei ling, which of course i said no.

i was really suspicious now, he carried on his story of saying that she is a chinese national that was being held by the interpol and my name was brought up in the picture. 

this was getting way way hilarious and i immediate REplied him: Interpol? okay fine, i will call them myself, (already knowing this was a hoax). he still continued by asking if i wanted the interpol's number? lol!!

I told him no thanks and put down the call.

I tried calling back the number but as per STARHUB ""the number is not available""

I log in to the scam alert webpage and saw similar incidents thus i know this was a scam

                The Scammer approached me via phone, saying that they could Give Me some loan. After collecting all the information, they reverted back and said i was qualified for the loan.


They asked to upfront transferred the deposit. After i transferred, they asked to transfer admin fees and all. I later realized it was a scammer and reported to police. They did not know I had filed a report and still tried to approach me asking for more money. After a while, i blocked them and they used another number to threaten me, then I Just changed my number.


The thing is i had already did a background check on this company. Their nAme is hms credit and it was listed down as a legal/Reliable moneylender On this page scamalert.com!!!!! I initially insisted to see them face to face before transaction but they said due to covid-19, they could not.


I learned a very hard lesson, so everyone Please watch out. Please only take up loans from bank. Even listed license lenders on this page are not reliable!

I met Clifford Weng on Meeff. He claimed to be half thai (dad) and Singaporean Chinese (mom) but born and raised in USA Florida. Works in Oil and gas industry. We chatted on Whatsapp and he always texted me in the morning and night every day without fail. He told me a lot of personal details about himself and his GF cheated on him last year and was heartbroken. 1 week later, he started to tell me that he has feelings for me and will send me flirty messages. He frequently send me selfie of himself. 2 weeks later, he told me that there is an important contract that he is bidding for and will be doing some shopping to prepare for his contract. The next day, he told me that he went shopping and he thought of me and bought some gifts for me and asked me for my shipping address so that he can send the gifts to me. I rejected him initially but he insisted that he wanted to do this due to his appreciation for me giving him back his faith in trust and friendship during his lowest time when he was emotionally drained due to his past relationship and he really appreciated my support as a good friend. He sounded so sincere so I gave him my contact details and address. He gave me the courier tracking link and the tracking number the next day. 1 week later the ‘Malaysia custom’ (+601133157142) texted me via Whatsapp that my package has arrived in Malaysia and I need to pay S$3000 to clear custom and overweight charges before they can deliver the package and I need to pay it asap before delivery insurance expires. I asked the Customs to send it back to the sender but they said that it is not possible. 

I asked Clifford what was included inside the package that weighed over 17kg and he told me that he send me expensive perfume, massager, female accessories, watches and cash of USD$10K for my inconvenience as I need to pay the excess charges and he urged me to pay them asap so as not to waste his effort of sending me the gifts. I requested the custom to show me proof of the package and the declaration of the items inside, they claimed that they are unable to do so. I told Clifford that I do not have the money to pay for it and he suddenly accused me of being ungrateful and how I do not appreciate all his effort in trying to make me smile. I also googled for the courier company and it seems fishy and fake hence I suspected that there is no such package in the first place. 

Thankfully I found this website after googling which showed many similar scams that happened before. I have reported and blocked them since. Hopefully this story helps to prevent others from getting scammed too.

WHEN INQUIRED on the nature of the summons, he requested for my name to check. thereafter, he requested for my nric number and that was when i hesitated and declined to furnish it to him. he claimed that two summons had been sent and since there was no reply, i was now required to attend court. when i questioned him on how was that possible since i was definitely home during the last 2 weeks given the covid19 shutdown, he sounded curt and was not unable to provide a coherent response. when i requested to speak to his supervisor, he became unhelpful and our call ended.

                Matched with an overzealous tinder profile by the name of , 33 years old.

He asked for my mobile number and took the conversation to WhatsApp almost immediately. introduced himself as “”. Right after, he unmatched me on Tinder. 

Initially claimed he’s from Hong Kong, but eventually admitted that he’s from China, ‘working and shuffling between Hong Kong and Singapore’. This was after I probed about why he was using simplified chinese when Hong Kong-ers typically use traditional Chinese. Strangest part of it all? The mobile number he’s using is tagged to a Philippines country code.

Within 2 days, he started dropping sweet nothings at an astronomical speed.

What I noticed was that his stories started to fall through the cracks and didn’t gel with what he had earlier claimed. Such as how his Hong Kong company had suddenly been ‘reclaimed’ within a grand total of 5 days.

Scanned the internet trying to find his social media profile. Instagram was non-existent and Facebook profile looked extremely dodgy.

Subsequently, he tried to get me to download some investment app and offered to ‘guide me through’ investment related matters - which I didn’t. 

Read up online and he was showing pretty much ALL signs of an online dating scammer; probably looking to dupe an innocent victim for an investment related scam. Apparently, this form of scam is getting more commonplace on social networking sites like Tinder.

I’ve since blocked him. 

I’m lucky to have been skeptical from the onset and evaded getting scammed. Though I thought I’d share this case before others fall prey to his ‘charms’.

I got an automated call coming from the sg court (spoofed number). I was given a case number and told that this was regarding a court case involving money laundering for which i had to show up. I was transferred to another person telling me that i should file a police report which would arm me for the court case. The scammer warned me of phone scams, let me check the Singapore Interpol number on the internet, hung up and called me from that very number (spoofed). I was asked to install the line app, provide identity details and was later asked about financial details (no account numbers or credit card numbers).

Identified himself as an employee of the High Court  stating that said call was a last notice of a sort. As i had no documents from the courts, i informed the scammer such,  thanked him,  and put down the phone. 

Scammer sounded local, but had a hint of foreign accent and did not address me by name.  

Simply hang up this call as Singapore High Court will not call you out of the blue!

                My helper almost got scammed just now. She asked me if i can help her pay on her behalf by transferring money over for her to buy facial products for her problem skin. 

After checking the source, I was very sceptical cos no reviews and the seller only joined in feb. But seeing that it was only $27, I transferred the money over. And gave my address and bank account details.

Then the game starts. Seller tried telling my helper sent wrong account no., said that account is supposed to be to the boyfriend and we have transferred wrongly. then said is correct will send item, then confirm that she cannot send cos money was sent to her boyfriend who is a cheat. Wasted 45min of my time.Hope she learns her lesson not to be too trusting.🤦🏼‍♀️

And in the message, many other addresses which seller claimed she has mailed the good before has been compromised as she started to show she is legit after we threatened to report to police.

I would like to remind one who see my post not to believe any cold calls, whatsapp from stranger and verify licensed money lender via ministry of law and only deal at registered office branch.
Now I was being threatened and the person whoever was it, took a picture of my unit door number and send me numerous burning, paint picture of vandalism to unit.
I never receive a single cent from loan scam and ended up paying $2000 for admin and holding charges.
The story goes:
On 15 Apr 2020, I received a call from vk chua 94342736 offering loan and claiming from katong credit, licensed moneylender (fake) and asked if I needed a loan. I mentioned 8000, however was told to take 10,000 instead. Monthly repayment of 577.10 for 18 months(translate to 4%per annum - too good to be true). After which he asked for my personal particular i.e bank account, cpf contribution, nric and my name card. He started sending me contract in pdf that looks real and i was convinced when he start mentioning there’s a admin fee of 1000 where i need to transfer to ocbc account first. On 855pm, i transferred via internet banking.
Next day 16 apr 2020, after transferring, he told me of the holding charge of another 1000 and it was refundable to verify my account but i told him i have no money. He convinced me if i dont pay, daily recurring holding charges will be charged. Being afraid, i managed to partial transfer 300 via internet banking to another account posb for holding charge.
On 17 apr 2020, another guy called sky 86535470 txt me claiming to cover vk chua and was convinced to pay remaining 700 holding charges.
On 18 apr 2020, boss Ron say i need to pay lawyer fee of 1000 with a forged pdf that they send me to sign. I spoke to Ron(HP 83871772) who was their boss and now insist to pay another 1000 for lawyer fee and i say i have no money at all, asking me to pay a sincerity fee of whatever amount i can find. Ending up demanding 500 or else cancellation fee of another 700 upfront I have to pay. I did not transfer the money and now with all the threaten and past picture of harassment was sent. I have blocked all 3 numbers and make police report.

My encounter is similar to what was already reported here. 
I received a phone call from a man with ""Indian"" accent who claimed to be from Singtel.
He said that I was having issues with my internet connection. The reason is because there are people misusing my internet for illegal stuffs. Hence, he is calling to offer troubleshoot services.
I find this phone call strange. Firstly, he did not introduce himself. Secondly, there are noisy background sounds behind. It seems like this phone call is recorded or calling from overseas.
I proceeded in asking him if he is calling from singtel. He said yes. I am not using singtel. He immediately hung up the phone.
Lesson learnt is, if you received such calls, just hang up.
Even if you are using singtel, there is no way singtel personnel would call you with regards to internet connection issues / they would not call without introducing themselves and they would provide you with singtel details instead. Stay calm and hang up the call.

He claimed to be Thai and singaporean mIx, raised In UK And has a foreign accent. He claimed to be working in an oil rig, wife passed away 4 years ago from cancer and has a 12 year old son that his mom is looking after. 

He said he admired me, and that I was interesting and wanted to be friends. Exchanged numbers and called me once or twice daily to have short 10-15 minute Calls. 

On the 3rd day of our calls, i told him about my own divorce and money issues with my ex husband, and how i was very skeptical about scammers and dating online. After that, he stopped calling or contacting me, maybe he realised he had no chance of me giving him any money i didn't have myself. did a reverse image search on his profile photo and found that he used a Thai socialite’s photo in his profile.

I received a phone call from a lady with an 'Indian' accent who claimed to be from Singtel. She said that I was having issues with my internet connection etc. so I told her that Singtel will not call up customers like that. She then said to give her a chance to show me what's wrong with my internet and that it's a free troubleshooting service she'll like to provide. I also noticed an echo in the background every time I spoke through the phone, which was odd. It's as if the call was recorded? in the entire phone call, I was quite skeptical but I followed along and she proceeded to ask me to open my computer and asked me if I'm in front of my computer. Next, she requested that I tell her what's on my screen right now. Of course, at this point, I couldn't stand the nonsense and told her ""it's okay, bye"". I hung up and she didn't call back. 

When you received such calls, hang up. Telecos will not call their customers to inform them of issues relating to their internet connection.

Consisting of, your masturbation video footage, which brings me to the primary reason why I am crafting this specific e-mail to you.


Well the previous time you went to the porn material online sites, my malware was triggered in your personal computer which ended up recording a eye-catching video of your masturbation play simply by triggering your web camera.

(you got a unquestionably strange preference btw haha)


I own the whole recording. If you think I am messing around, just reply proof and I will be forwarding the particular recording randomly to 3 people you recognize.


It might be your friend, co workers, boss, mother and father (I'm not sure! My software program will randomly select the contacts).


Would you be able to gaze into anyone's eyes again after it? I doubt that...


However, it doesn't have to be that route.


I want to make you a one time, no negotiable offer.


Purchase $ 2000 in bitcoin and send it on the down below address:

[case-sensitive copy and paste it, and remove *** from it]


(If you do not understand how, lookup how to buy bitcoin. Do not waste my precious time)


If you send out this particular 'donation' (why don't we call it that?). After that, I will go away for good and under no circumstances get in touch with you again. I will delete everything I have got in relation to you. You may very well proceed living your current regular day to day life with zero concern.


You've got 1 day in order to do so. Your time starts as soon you go through this e-mail. I have got an special program code that will notify me once you read this e mail therefore don't try to play smart.

                I happened to see some loan advertisement On facebook and decided to click and check out hup hoe credi? pte ltd and sgeasycredit. I was then directed to whatsapp by facebook where i was handled by these two companies. They mentioned that i could borrow sgd50k and 60 months repayment period of sgd900 per month (this interest rate is so low and even lower than banks). They then asked for the following information in order to process the loan:

1) ic front and back

2) income statement 3months latest

3) name card

4) 2 next of kin contact  for  application form

5) bank account


I was so tempted but i then told mysef that i need to perform more research before giving my personal information. I then google and came across this scam alert website. After going through the website and past scam Stories. I then realised that i have possibly encountering loan scam. I could also find sgeasycredit in one of the past loaN scam story. One thing to Note, hup hoe credi? was listed in the registered money lender list too.


I realised that the loan and Low interest offered are too good to be true. We have to keep reminding ourselves that there are no such goodies especially during this difficult time. They even wanted to call me in order to expedite the loan processing.

I was told there is a complaint from ""Singapore Interpol"" for ""Money Laundering"" based on arrests made in China. I was taken aback, on further enquiry the person gave me some names which were totally unrelated to me & asked if knew them. After denying that i knew them, i was told this case is pending & i need to appear in court next monday upon which i will be arrested for questioning. 

Smelling something fishy, i insisted i will go to the nearest NPC & sort it out. The person on call kept insisting, NPC won't be able to help as the complain has been launched by ""Singapore Interpol""  after this i didnt continue conversation. Politely, told him i need to talk to my lawyer and if there is any case he will be taking care of it on my behalf & disconnected the line.

Then rushed to the nearest NPC. They assured me this is a new scam recently going around to exhort money & i don't need to worry as any such issue will always only be through police & high court will never cut them off the loop & intervene.

(you got a tremendously unusual taste by the way lmfao)

I have got the entire recording. In the case you feel I am playing around, just reply proof and I will be forwarding the recording randomly to 8 people you're friends with.

It might be your friends, co workers, boss, mother and father (I'm not sure! My software will randomly pick the contact details).

Will you be able to gaze into anyone's eyes again after it? I question it...

However, it does not need to be that route.

I want to make you a one time, no negotiable offer.

Buy USD 2000 in bitcoin and send them to the listed below address:

bc1***qvxfkdtvx8mt4zu2ln85fpewxj3z3k7c6hcc4??(Fraudulent bitcoin wallet)
[CASE SENSITIVE copy & paste it, and remove *** from it]

(If you do not understand how, look online how to buy bitcoin. Do not waste my precious time)

If you send out this particular 'donation' (why don't we call this that?). Immediately after that, I will go away and under no circumstances make contact with you again. I will eliminate everything I've got in relation to you. You may very well proceed living your current normal day to day life with zero concern.

You've 24 hours to do so. Your time starts as soon you read through this e mail. I have an one of a kind code that will alert me as soon as you go through this mail so don't attempt to play smart.

                I received a robocall from 65 68198822 and +65 68943861, the call claimed that a document is pending and that I should press a certain number to verify my number. 
 
I then received another call from +65 81880956, i initially DID NOT PICKUP THE CALL and when i called back - it was prepaid mobile number, which was unavailable.

The incident happened twice in the past and today (16 apr 20). today the frequency of the calls was higher. the calls were received thrice within a span of 60 mins. 

To ascertain whether the calls were genuine, i checked with the moh hotline (1800 333 9999). the MOH operator checked their database and confirmed that the above numbers did not belong to their database.

The operator also mentioned, that if a moh representative would reach out over the phone, it would be a person and not an automated voice response (AVR) system.

                I was contacted on 15 April 2020 through an automated phone call from the above mentioned number. the voice told me the call came from Singapore supreme court and asked me to press a certain button in order to be forwarded to someone in charge.

an employee then inquired About my call and hinted that i probably had received a summons which i denied. he then asked my for my full Name and fin number and eventually told me that i was involved in charges against a certain christina (followed by a chinese surname) concerning money laundering and that there was a summons for 20 April.


He then concluded the call by promising to get back to me.

So, this caller (+65 6887 8888), he said that he's calling from Marina Bay Financial Centre.

He claimed to be Tan Bun Yue - a staff of DBS main branch. He informed me that I applied for credit card in Beijing, China He went to to tell me the address that the card was registered to in China. 

He said i needed to pay $1,265 because there was a transaction in beijing, for an iphone xr I told him that I didn't go to Beijing. He then went on to comment that my personal details might be used illegally. 

he also says that the credit card number  that apply in beijing was xxxx xxxx 8721 8600. 

but after end of call with tan bun yue, i call to dbs hotline, they say i have no card number xxxx xxxx 8721 8600. So this is a fraud case 

A total of 3 calls were made from these numbers 658770 8632 and 6568878888.

I transferred $350 to OCBC xxx-1-073939, later seller message need insurance fee for delivery department to deliver the item and it is refundable upon delivery. I replied no more money in my bank, then asked to buy 2 SIM card to ""waive"" the insurance fee. bought 2 sim cards, asked to insert to phone and provide activation code and destroy the sim card.

Seller never deliver item and requested to buy another sim card, stupid me continue to do as per request. asking seller when deliver, replied me ""please appreciate the effort she putting in order to waive the insurance fee"".

I messaged seller going to make police report, seller replied ""good luck"".

Made a police report, officer told me during this circuit breaker, this scam cases increased within a few days. 

Police officer told me this scam involved job scam, the bank account no. belong to another victim from job scam doing online job by transferring money in and out. scammer use the sim card bought by victim to list new online purchase through lazada, shopee etc. 

Police officer requested me to deactivate/disconnect all the phone no., all phone no cannot get through but still can receive message through whatsapp from scammer

                A very confident-sounding guy called at close to 12 noon claiming someone was trying to hack into our computer. said he was from singtel and needed me to open up my computer to follow his instructions. 

I am security-trained so i was skeptical and asked for his name, id no. and address. he said his name was Alan Christopher, id no. 15787, from 5 maxwell road 0300 tower block mnd complex. he even said i could check his identity on my phone now. I called Singtel later and they confirmed there is no one working by the name of Alan Christopher

                received an email with one of my frequently used passwords as subject title on 14 april. 

sender has stated that he got access to my password and more compromising photos/videos that he will send to 10 random contacts in my network if i do not comply with sending over $2000 (in bitcoin) to him within 24 hours of receiving that email. 
(it said that a computer code was inserted in the email so it will know when i have read it).

it gave me 3 options: 1) pretend that it's a bluff and ignore, 2) reply with ""proof"" or 3) pay out $2000 to it via bitcoin. option 1 will lead to mailing video footage of me to current social networks and phone connections. 

the payment of $2000 is to wipe out everything it has concerning me.

I have yet to transfer any payment and have deleted the email as per what other victims have done in this scam alert page.

I received this whatsapp from this number 65 98957255 (SG mobile No.) Message reads: Good Day Sharon, Trust you are doing fine? I'm David Wong. You seem very much familiar to me. Guess we must have met before but can't recall where in Singapore. Guess we must have met one of the showflats in Singapore still can't remember. I was away during Lunar New Year. My mother was very sick in Australia. I'm trying to buy a house in Singapore for my sick mother. I don't know how you could be of a help. I need to know types of houses available, keep in touch. Regards"" I asked & he replied he is currently in Sydney and wish to buy a house in SG within budget of S$3mil to S$4mil.  
On 22-02-2020, gave his Aust mobile no. +61421816242 & requested that we communicate via that. He shared his mom's poor health condition & asked me to pray for her recovery. He asked about my job (realtor), hobbies/interests, etc. He sent me pics of him with 2 grown-up sons & ex-wife, nice pics of his home's garden, charming pics of himself. His 2 sons & ex-wife in US. His age is 63+ & works as consultant. He said I'm his soulmate whom he enjoys chatting with. I'm always on his mind. He flew & arrived in Florida (Jacksonville) on 02-03-2020 to settle some contracts with the govt office.  He said he will fly to Singapore to meet me after he settled the important matters in Florida.
On another day, he told me that his worker -  Johnson Lee - will be in SG on 15-03-2020 to assist him in purchase of  lubricant, jet oil, etc from ExxonMobil.   On 16-03-2020, Jackson whatsapp from mobile no. +65 91574284 that he arrived in SG and had busy day on appointments with Exxon and Shell companies for purchases of Aero jet fluid, petrochemical oil, crude oil, etc. 
David then sent me Purchase Order with pics of various types of oil  (see attachments) & asked my help for S$14,500, as he is short of funds.   I told him I don't have money to help him.  He was upset & called me heartless.  He then reduced amount from S$14,500 to S$6,000 then to S$5,000 but I maintained that I do not have financial means to help him.   He then turned angry & blocked me from his WhatsApp.  I am certain that Johnson is David's accomplice.  I found Johnson's pics on facebook with name David Wong.
While reading stories posted in ScamAlert website, I saw a story posted on 26 Nov 2019 that scammer Mok (56 years old) whose photo looks like same person as this scammer David Wong.  I also found David Wong’s profile pics on Facebook but information given (such as From Hongkong, Lives in Singapore) are different from this scammer who told me that he's an Australian since birth.

Please be wary of strangers who get in touch with you online.

                A 'prospect tenant' named Zhu Lan contacted me on gumtree, Saying she a sg PR returning from overseas. In the initial email, the person send me 'her' ic S80779??G  which at first seems like a sincere person looking for a room. However, the first red flag was tHAt she agree to everything very quickly, offering to rent the room and declining to view it personally when asked

The person even offered to pay the rent of the first 6 months, as 'she' need to show the employer the proof of rent before she can quit her current overseas job as a cruise chef.

The second red flag was when she asked me to register for a paypal account in a perfect and very well worded email The next thing was the whatsapp number 'she' provide was a +63 philippines number. 

on top of that she kept on shifting her moving in date over the next few days. on top of that due to the COVID-19 restrictions, she has to be quarantined at a govt designated facility and when asked, she deflected the question

Only after i did some search did i come across the exact same scam happening to others the past few months. I am lucky to not have lost any money to this scam and was already thinking of going to the police report the impersonation of the person and illegal usage of the IC

So beware If someone approaches you to give you months' of rental in advance with no questions asked

I received an SMS about personal loans, then to find out more. The person said he can only loan $700, no upfront pay fees or other types of fees. He advised me just sent him my account number and I/c photo and home address to him. 
After 1 hour, he replied my SMS telling me that my cash was ready to deposit into my account. 
He said that after 5 days, to return $950. I then declined to take up the loan and didn’t want his money. He said that couldn’t “return now” and must return $950 after 5 days and will give me the account number to deposit the money into. He said if I didn’t return, he would charge a deference fee and I don’t pay, he would come to my house!

                I went to the meeting spot then suddenly i need to talk to the manager so they ask me to buy alipay card as payment for the service. 

Then after that, I realised that something wasn't right and when I said that I didn't want service, they kept pushing me to make payment. After refusing requests for payment, person started threatening me and claimed that he's from some .

The scammer claims he placed a malware on site i visited and claim to have accessed to my display screen and webcam. It also claimed his malware already gathered all my contacts from messenger, facebook account and emails. if i do not pay him a non-negotiable $1900, he would sent some explicit photos or videos of me to all my contacts.

They said I was due in court urgently on monday 13th april on money laundering charges related to the case of Christina Loh Mei Ling with case number 071875.
After considering this information, I hung up the phone and called the High Court directly to check because it sounded like a scam. The high court general enquiries line confirmed this was a scam they were aware of and these details were not true.

Due to the covid-19, I had lost my job. I was looking for some emergency aid. I browse through the internet and found this alltimecredit. I was told do give my personal particulars such as name, address and NRIC no. 
After about 30mins, the guy alias Alan, told me that my loan was approved but I had to pay some fees upfront. I was so happy and did not hesitate. I paid $35,500 in total and did not receive anything. I regretted and learnt my lesson in a hard way. One thing that taught me was this company do not even have a company phone number.
So please beware before you apply for loans, make sure they have a valid office number.

the charge on my credit card statement showed the reference as 'quizine.sg +44 12 2498 0DK'. i recognised this charge and hence didn't pay heed to it. however, today when i checked my online banking, there was a charge of $49.95 dated 5th april on the same credit card with the same reference 'quizine.sg +44 12 2498 0Dk'. straight away i realised something was wrong. i blocked my credit card and here i am reporting this scam. i do not recall to the best of my knowledge/memory ever making this $49.95 payment in the last few days.

He told me that he is a real estate developer. On one occasion, he told me that he was doing some shopping and he decided to buy something for me and sent it over as a surprise. I told him not to send the package over and wait for him to return but he insisted to send over. I asked what he sent over, but he refuse to say. I only came to know that he is sending a large package after he went to the courier and the courier contacted me of the shipment details. I started questioning him and asked why would he want to send a large package. We are not even close friends. He told me that i have to pay a custom clearance fee of sgd3000 when the shipment arrived. he knew i am not going to pay that amount and he offer to put some money in the package. 

Okay, finally got notified by the courier that shipment has arrived. I trusted him initially and proceed to make a initial payment of sgd3000. I was given this account to bank in the cash. 

Account name: G poor****
account number: 195224***
Bank Name: DBs

they only accept cash deposit and no other forms of transfer.

but this did not come to the end. after two days, courier informed me that the customs scanned my package and noticed some foreign currencies in the package. I was told to make another payment of sgd 13500 to procure anti-money laundering documentation.  I was given another account to bank in cash using above method.
Account NAME : LEe POOi ****
Account number: 120501****
Bank name: DBS

I ring up the shipper ( so called the person i know online) and text the courier via Whatsapp to ask what is happening. THe shipper told me he was putting cash that is above the limit. I told him that it was illegal to do so and he require to declare. He claim he is not aware. I WAS RUSHED TO MAKE PAYMENT BY BOTH THE SHIPPER AND COURIER. I WENT TO MAKE PAYMENT VIA OVER-THE-COUNTER AT THE BANK.

A call from 68645723 was received at 11:22 am 31mar 2020. An automated voice message was telling me i have been summoned by the singapore high court.
I press ""9"". Then i waited for a few rings then a guy in english answered me. ""singapore high court how can i help"".
I told him i received a call as per the voice message. He told me to give the case number. I said i dont have and he ask me to provide my full name and nric number. At that time i was already double checking contact info the high court and thus he was hearing me type on my keyboard. Then he drop the call.
I tried calling back the number but as per singtel ""the number is not available""
I called afterwards at singapore high court to check if the call was legit. But they say they only give summon by registered mail or email, thus i got a scam call.

                Received this automated call in Chinese saying it's from MOH, was redirected to someone who also spoke in Chinese asking me if I received any messages from moh. I felt it was off. Why would moh contact me with a Chinese speaking co and why at all. He said they had a Chinese department and then told me to go down to collect documents at moh office. I told him I'll check later myself and he just hung up.

                I saw an offer for new iphone 7 plus 256gb for $300 at lazada. Chatted with the seller to request for receipt. He requested to have a chat via whatsapp for better communication and liaising.

Gave him my number and he texted me at night sharing with me the details of the phone. I replied ok and wanted to make payment via lazada but after much persistent from him to transfer him directly for easy transaction, i agreed as i ahve liaise with such seller before. He gave me ocbc bank acnt but as im lazy i requested for dbs bank account instead. He is very persistent and will keep calling and spam text you till you transfer. In the end I transferred and he promised item to be delivered on the same day at 9pm. After hours later he texted me to transfer $200 for insurance and tax as my item is stuck and need to pay that additional amount. I reluctant and request for refund. Again his persistent and keep calling and text me to transfer. I refuse and told him i will make a report and as usual this kind of person is not scared as they know nothing will happen to them.

Received a phone call from +6564385155, claimed that he is calling from ICA. The man sounds like a caucasian, then started to ask questions like how long i have been in singapore, and what am i doing here? I felt fishy and quickly passed the call to my husband. When my husband ask what is his name is, the man started to be aggressive and ask to give back to phone to me instead so he can continue his interrogations. The man started to say vulgar words ""f..k u"" , then we hanged up the call and blocked the number. We tried to call back the same number and found out that it was registered to a company in Singapore.

Editor's Note: Scammers are using spoofing technology to create fake numbers to cover tracks and to fool people into picking up their phone calls. This means that the numbers displayed on users’ Caller IDs are often fake and untraceable, or belong to some innocent parties who didn’t make the calls. The more effective and long term solution is to educate users on how to spot the scam so that they don’t fall prey to them.

                I'm going to share on how the scam works. I have tried this out of curiosity to experience what the victims are going through. The Credit for Sex Scammers usually don't have a local number tied to their advertisement, instead they will use a Line-ID or a WeChat-ID. The only way to connect with them is via these apps. They can advertise their services on Locanto, or Tinder or any other possible websites. The one I experienced was via Locanto, and was directed to add this person on WeChat.


Upon contacting the ""masseuse"" or the ""escort"", they will pretend it is a legitimate proposition by asking you when you would like to meet them. Once you have given them a date and a time, they will ask for your location. The location I was given was “102 Yishun Avenue 5”. Upon arriving at the location, the girl will request for you to take a picture of your surroundings to indicate you have reached the meeting place. Next, they will ask you for your contact number so that their “friend” can contact you with further instructions and direct you to their actual location.


Once you have given your contact number, their friend will call you via an Unknown or Private number, and ask you a series of questions. The questions asked will be whether or not this is your first time with this girl and if you have any friends or family who are in the police force. Once they have verified that this is your first time and that you do not have any connections to the police, this is when they will proceed with the scam. He will then ask you to pay a deposit of $100 or $200 for the services which you requested via an AXS machine, selecting the Top Up – Alipay option with their e-mail given to you by the girl via the messaging app. This is the first red flag! Once you have done so, you will be requested by the girl to take a picture of the receipt and send via the app. Next, the “friend” will then ask you to make a “refundable deposit” of $1,200 as this is their company policy. They will justify it by saying that the girl is a student and is doing this illegally, the money will be used to bail them out in the event they are caught and deported back. Do not transfer the money! Second red flag!


Once you have rejected transferring the money, he will begin to threaten you by saying he have your contact number and will track you down and hurt your family. They will then negotiate with you by asking you to make a smaller amount for deposit. The girl will even call you on the messaging app to plead with you that it is for your safety. Stay calm! This is all a scam. Stop topping up nor deposit any more money and report to the police.

                Saw a drone in shopee (swiss limited), and was interested to get it. When i chat with the seller on shopee platform, an automated message saying ""interested buyer please whatsapp to 92453326"". I whatsapp him (HE NAMED HIMSELF ""NAYA"") and he said orders have to be directed to them as they are only using the shopee platform for advertisment. So after much convincing, i decided to trust him and transfer him $300 to his Malaysia acc (he claimed that their sg ocbc acc is down). He promised that the delivery will be the next day. The following day, he texted saying that they have run out of stock and will have to deliver from their malaysia store and that will cost another $300 for tax and insurance fees. I told him i can't pay so much, then he offered to help me pay $100 so i just needed to pay another $200, which will be refunded when they deliver the item. So i transfer another $200, but the item was not received on the same day. The following day (today), he claimed that their delivery van is spoiled, which caused the delay in delivery. He promised that the drone will be delivered today. After a while, he claimed that there is another issue and that will require me to transfer another $400 for stamp fees (WHICH HE CLAIMED WILL BE REFUNDED WHEN THE ITEM IS BEING DELIVERED). AT THIS POINT OF TIME, I KNEW it was a scam. Currently, i am in the process of contacting his boss (nor arian Binti Sama) to request a full refund. 🤞🏼

                I met this lady on tinder stating that she is opened to making new friends followed by her Line ID. As my intention was to get to know how to commjnicate with ladies better, i decided to message her. In our conversation she didnt mentioned anything about the amount needed to pay to meet up with her. So on 18 March 2020, the date we decided to meet, she asked me to give her my contact number for her 'friend' to give me a call regarding their procedure of meeting up. And there were a few calls made by 2 different persons without any caller ID. Through our conversation, they have requested for me to transfer first $100 followed by $600 and $1000 done via alipay on the axs machine. When they asked me transfer the $1000 i was feeling abit suspicious about the conversation and decided to transfer $300 claiming that I do not have sufficient amount to transfer the full $1000. And in our last call, after I raised the concern about not being able to transfer the remaining $700 and requested for the refund of a total of $1000, he began to threatened me saying that If I were to pull anymore tricks, they would come and haunt me and my family.

Note to all other individuals who are going to experience this scam:
1. Check if any payment is needed to be paid upfront before meeting up. If yes, dont bother meeting up with the other person. But if you still insist on wanting to meet up check the amount to be paid first 

2. When you are asked to give your phone number for her 'friend' to call you, do not ever give your phone number

3. Once it reached the threatening phase, request for the longest possible timing to look for funding and take this opportunity to go and make a police report.

he wants me to go to my computer so he can guide me step-by-step on how to resolve that issue. that raised my suspicion so i questioned what exactly is the issue and how this issue came about. he replied saying it is because my computer don't have firewall thus it increases risk of having my password and sensitive information being leaked. thus he will need to guide me step by step on my computer and gain remote access to my computer to fix this. like hello? i confirmed have firewall in place and giving you remote access is super dangerous, you can really then access all my password and sensitive information!

i rejected going to my computer and he wont give up by saying that he wants to schedule an appointment with me to resolved this issue. i said i was busy and hang up.  

afterwards i search official microsoft website on whether they will do this, turns out even on the official website, microsoft warns against having their staff calling customer for computer issues as their software are ASSURED against these type of technical issues.

                I first received a phone call from a girl with Indian accent who claimed to be sophie soon from microsoft tech support team. She had my name, Email and number. She told me that there were problems with my computer but I told her that I didn't experience any problem and my computer was new. She said she will show me the PROBLEMs. After receiving multiple calls from her, I relented as I did an old computer which was problematic and I sent a diagnostic report to Microsoft. She asked me to run a series of codes via the command box and fooled me into thinking that there was a problem with my computer. I later found out that the ""problems"" existed in all computers. She then wanted to gain remote access to my computer and I felt uncomfortable, so I questioned her identity and she gave me all except for her company phone number. I grew suspicious and CONTINUEd to question her about THe number she used to call me. She immediately transferred my call to her supervisor, a guy with indian accent who was more adept at talking. I granted remote access although I felt uncomfortable and he started running diagnostic tests on my computer. He then asked for my name, billing address, email and phone number which I thought they should already have. I divulged everything excerpt for my billing address. I then called Microsoft to verify while they had remote access to my computer...I managed to abort the connection when they tried  install something on my computer by accepting risks. They then made another 10 calls to my phone which I did not pick up. Although I have reinstalled windows on my computer and ran a few antivirus scans, I'm still worried that they may misuse my information  out of revenge or installed any trojan in my computer.

I saw a part time/full time job advert on carousell. i cant remember his Carousell account as i didnt keep record.
i wanted to look for extra income so i actually went to click onto the link and it linked to his whatsapp number +65 8697 1085. his ic no : s894105?? pan houro?? , samuel. on last saturday , 7th mar , he replied me. our conversation was too long. he mentioned this job is flexible and i can do it where ever there is a post office in the area. he also said he wished to meet up with me but he is in new york as an architect and will come back to singapore in june. the whole message sounded real. i was required to mail the packages/mails to where he wants me to mail them to. the content of the packages will be business/personal mails. he will pre pay me first and work less than 15/20 hour per week and get more than $200 as an account personnel. 
he also mentioned its 101% legal and real job. i sent him my ic and bank acc as he requested. on monday , he used different bank accounts with different names to transfer me $2650 without telling me beforehand that he will transfer. when he already transferred, it was already too late for me to report. he also said he will email me offer letter one week later. he told me to transfer $2630 to Mifeng’s DBS account. I did it at atm machine on the same day on tuesday , he transferred me $1849 and i was told to transfer $1840 to 2880169??-? lim seow h?? DBS, but that time I was working and he kept on pestering me and when I went to ATM machine after work , i realised my posb acc has been frozen by the police. I was so stressed because of him and the police officer told me to wait for his call and he will tell me when to come down for statement. I really thought that this was a real job because everything sounds real. so currently his money and my savings are stuck in my account and I was so helpless.

Dear sirs,
Yesterday and this morning, I received a call on my mobile with an automated voice message informing me that the caller was from DBS bank and that my account is having some inconsistencies and my account will be close immediately. If i want to know more details to hit a certain number. I immediately cut off caller since i am alert about such scams. Had reported a singtel scam to both the council and the police some mid 2019.
I reported yesterday's scam call to DBS and their customer service confirmed it was a scam call since they have no record of the bank calling me.
The 2 numbers that called were:
Yesterday: 65 6369 5008 
This morning: 65 8841 3640.

1) how it happened:
On march 10, 2020, 17:14pm, this man by the name of Roger Davis called my handphone.
His incoming number is 91304481. (singapore line)
He says he is calling from company: imda (infocomm media development authority) of singapore.
He has a strong indian-speaking accent as he was conversing in english with me.
He says their technology system has detected that my computer is having damages in ""tools and services"".
He informed me that he will need to access my computer and help to solve the issue.
If i did not get it check, my computer will get hacked easily due to no security services, and i will lose important info like financial info in my pc.
I asked which computers, saying that i have many computers. He said ""the personal computer"".
Actually, my computer has no problem. And i am amazed that they know ""which computer is personal"" or ""which computer is for business"". So this is already a fishy part.
To add on, a few weeks ago, some other man called my mobile too about the same computer issue.
He says he is calling from Microsoft
He also has a strong indian-speaking accent.
So i suspected they are from the same syndicate, citing big corporate names to fool the public.
Nothing was lost. Because i thought it was too suspicious and did not divulge any confidential information.
I did not continue the conversation upon having suspicions.

                This person with an accent that sounded from india called me at my handphone number using the phone number +6563107171 and asked for 'jack' (not my name). 

i told him that he looked for the wrong person, and he repeated my number to me, then he asked me to pass to the right person.

So i asked him what is this phone call purpose in regards to?

he CLAIMED TO BE FROM SINGTEL, and told me that someone bad is trying to access to my internet connection, and to prevent that, he advised me to sign up for protection.

so i asked him to send me an email regarding this ""protection"" plan that he has.

And he hysterically became bad tempered and started scolding me on why should he send me an email if i am not the right person.

several alert ringed me that he is a scammer:
- he looked for 'jack', and i believe my handphone number have been with me and no one named 'jack' ever got hold of this number for the past 2 decades
- i do not have any personal internet subscription with singtel

so while he was still berating me on the phone, i gave up listening to him, and gave him a warning:
i know that you are a scammer and i will report you to the police, then i hanged up

after hanging up, i went online to look up at the phone number, and i realized that the phone number could be from india.

                i met Thomas Peter Huang via the league app, the app that declares verifications are in place to ensure there would not be any fake profile in their app.


Name: Thomas P

Details: Woodland, 45 years old, 180cm

Education: University of Aberdeen and University of Texas at Austin and a PhD holder.

Profession: Self-independent contractor – Perenco (later he deleted “Perenco” from his bio)

Verified: Linkedin, Facebook, Twitter

Interests: Cycling xxxx (I couldn’t recall the details) | The Great Gatsby | Mayor of Casterbridge


He mentioned that he is an engineer in petroleum industry and he would be heading to Kiev, Ukraine soon for his project. During his trip, he hoped we could continue to talk and get to know each other before we meet face to face. He shared that he was the only child and chose a simple life. His parents passed away and he is on his own. It was a very convenient story to tell.


My suspicion started to arise when I could not find him in any platform that verified him. he declared that he had left the league app. Thankfully, I was still in the app. One day accidently I saw another profile on the app. The face was different with Thomas, but the bio was 90% match. When I say match, it means every wording is a match. It includes university they went for study, favourite food, their interest in books and cycling. I am not sure if Thomas used this guy’s bio or both are fake profiles.


One day he shared his contract document with a company that he claimed to be his client. He said it was confidential document, but he trusted me enough to share it with me. He used this trick to show that he was real, yet there was a few mistakes in the documents:

1. The company doesn’t seem to have any subsidiary in Ukraine as it was claimed to be.

2. The company address on the letter head is an abandoned building in Ukraine.

3. There was no name of director who signed the contract.

4. There was no company logo on the letter head.

5. Lastly, there was typo in the document.


A few days later, he mentioned there was a cyber glitch around the rig where he was working. He asked me to switch to hangout app as his phone number and WhatsApp will be monitored for safety precaution. he could access hangout app because the app uses email instead of phone number.


When I asked him about his linkedin account, he explained that he deactivated his account.

I reported and blocked his number on WhatsApp. I also contact the league help support to report a scam. I gave all details about Thomas,  and the profile of the guy whose bio has 90% match with Thomas.  thomas might be a vip member in the league. Hopefully the league can trace him through his payment detail.

By then i was feeling afraid so decided to just send them the $100 they asked for a peace of mind, but then it escalated to $600 more, i figured it's fine as long as everyone is safe. but even after that, he asked for more so i just blocked them altogether. all these were done so even without leaving my house, through the axs app.

Met daniel through cmb app. After reading the accounts here, he triggered many warning bells.
- initially he was very intense and claimed he was dating to settle down and get married
- his fiancee slept with his friend and left him one month before his wedding
- he quickly move our conversation to wechat from cmb
- was requested not to tell any of my friends about our interactions
- claimed that his parents divorced when he was young and his mum took him to us to live with his uncle
- claimed to be a geologist from baltimore, maryland and decided to go independent
- have no social media profile
- was bidding for an oil rig project with the ukraines in the dnipro for a project in the black sea and won the project. However, he had issues transporting his expensive equipment and one of it was damaged and held custody in turkey. Wanted to borrow 5,000 and i declined
 
Thereafter, i did a google image search on the photos he had given me and it was linked to a doctor based in malaysia. That's how i knew i was tricked.

                I matched this girl ""carrie"" on tinder, who offered 2hours for $100. so i agreed to meet, the moment i got there, i RECEIVED a call from a china man. he instructed me that the girl was a student, and needed protection, thus asking me to transfer some money by buying the mycard points on axs machine, which would be refunded after the services. after i did so On the $600, i was instructed to transfer yet another $800, which i only transferred $200 as I was starting to feel odd about the whole affair. After that, i started receiving death threats, telling me how they would find me through my handphone number and kill my family and i. i've proceeded to block and ignore all their calls/messages.

                I've seen this a lot of times recently, this is the third time a friend of mine was impersonated, all on instagram. The first time, it was my boyfriend's mother (her instagram username was xxxx, they changed it to caroline_teo???), the next time it was a friend i haven't spoken to in ages (Amanda?? to amandaa??) and the third time, was a girl i hadn't spoken to in awhile as well (hoyeex to hhoyeex). These are really common, and they often choose usernames that are really similar, and difficult to detect if they are false. Of course, this is partially due to the accounts being public, thus letting them copy the pictures. The first time they asked for my phone number (i gave it because i thought it really was my boyfriend's mum), and asked if i could give my bank account details and click an SMS link. Thankfully, my account is a uk number, and thus i did not receive it- i do not think the message could send. I thus kept the conversation going to try and figure the identity of the scammer, but all i managed to get was that he spelled singapore as sinapur, and was thus likely from india (their cities spell 'pore' as 'pur'). The second time they did not message me, and the third time, they asked for my phone number (i gave the police number), of which they said they sent an sms code to it, and asked me to send it to them to verify. As i 'played' with them to try and get more information since it was evidently a scam, they accidentally typed some words in romanian, and deleted it a few seconds later. I tried to continue the conversation but they ignored me afterwards. No money was lost in any of these three situations, but the cases really are on the rise, so i thought it'd be nice to perhaps inform and warn more people of such scams. Thanks!

Out of the blue i received a call from +63731341304 saying they are calling from singtel and my internet is having errors. I realized this moment that it was a scam call as i wasn't using singtel as my isp. But just to waste their time, i started acting dumb. The lady said my router is having errors and asked me to check the status of the lights. I told her they were solid no blinking. Then she said she'll escalate the call to her senior engineer. So senior engineer then told me that my internet was being misused by people from remote parts of the world and wanted to check my router. He commanded me to turn on the computer to which i said i don't have one. Then he passed the call back to the lady and who asked me why i lied to her ""senior"". I continued to play dumb and explained that i had several devices connected to my wifi but none of them were a pc. Then she asked if she can get me a computer to which i said i only use a smart tv to work. I asked her to send a personnel to my house address to check out the issue to which she accepted and hung up the call.

Editor's Note: Please do not engage with scammer and our advice is to end the call the moment you realised that call is a scam.

She became nasty and said she is very busy and got a lot of peoples that she needs to call. after that she gave a set of phone number (not my director's mobile) and i said not this number. she said the record is not updated on MOM’s record which at last i told her i will call her back and she told me the line is very busy and i shall not call and said i am wasting her time and she immediately cut off my phone. after that i called MOM main line and they told me there is no such person or such arrangement (refer to sms) by MOM.

                Received a call on 3 march and the caller claimed that he was calling from Singtel informing me that my internet has been hacked. When i tried to ask him which internet service he was referring to, he could not pinpoint which internet service i had with singtel and repeatedly saying he was calling from singtel. 

From there, i knew it was a scam call as i did not have any internet service signed with singtel under my name. As i picked this up quite quickly, i did not reveal anything to the caller but questioned him on my details that he has in his record which he could not answer at all. 

I prompted the caller if he is going to continue i will make a police report on this call and I hung up the phone

I received a call 10min later from +08602121257 also stating that our router has a problem. I was suspicious, so I played along... they used some nonsense technical explanations and then asked me to check the router and provide my NRIC.


I asked them for the residential address where the router is, saying i have 2 residences (guessing that they had no clue). They hang up.

                In brief on 12 Feb 2020, I received a SMS from the money lending company that it provides loans. The SMS stated as No late charges and No deposit with the maximum loan of $100,000

As my F&B business failed very badly, I decided to take up the loan to pay up all my outstanding debts. I decided to contact the financial adviser by the name of Elbert from JML Credit Solutions, License no. 201900883G and I took up a loan of $50,000 with repayment of $920 per month for 5 years.

The loan didn’t happen after making a deposit of multiple transfer to the various unknown accounts adding up a lost of $6110. They denied that I have made the  payment and would want me to pay another $2400. I refuse to however, I received a death threat from them and that resulted me to  report this matter to the police.  Two detailed police reports were lodged, F/20200301/7001 and F/20200301/7002.

i went into my shoppee account and saw 3 orders of total about $310. luckily the credit card info that i had in shoppee was for an old card and the transaction was not successful.


I called bank and cancelled cc card that i have and i have also deleted my shoppee account.


following this, my email was hacked! someone replaced my email address with him or hers - [email protected] immediately i changed my password and replaced the email address once again.


now it seems that my fb account is also being hacked! i am trying to do everything possible to safeguard my account and hopefully, everything will be ok.

she wont have singapore money. she insisted me to open Paypal account and she would be transferring rental amount to my paypal account. 

I thought she is genuine person. later she asked me favor to do and mentioned  ""shipping agent says  she will need to pay for the moving before they can ship my items, they charge HER $400 SGD for pick up and delivery and payment for pick up will be made to the corporate international headquarters in Philippines.""

SHe said she will transfer money via Paypal. but the Tricky thing  she maDE is  until uNless i pay $400 to Shipping agent that the rental advance will not be credited to  my account. nothing is  credited to  my account soon i realised this is looking a kind of online scam. i told her unless money credited to My account i can't pay any money for shipping agenT.

I am still monitoring how the response would be from the scammer.

he said he is a serious buyer and wanted to purchase the laptop. claims that he is offshore and wants to purchase the laptop for his daughter.  offered to transfer funds first and get a courier to pick-up the laptop.  i said i usually deal person-to-person only, but agreed to it as he needs to purchase urgently before his daughter goes to camp.

following morning, he provides screenshot of bank of america transaction claiming he has transferred the funds and has been deducted from his account. even provided a screenshot of his bank account (now, who does that?  seriously?)  i said I will not release the laptop until the funds are properly reflected.  he starts accusing me of pulling a fast one on him and that he trusted me.  no funds have been received.

noticeably, his responses are far in between, which only means he is busy scamming other people while communicating with me.  his bank of america screenshots have misspellings and inconsistencies.

                I received a phone call on my house telephone. The scammer first introduced himself, saying that he is from Singtel and he is calling with regards to an issue with my house internet broadband service. Next he would go on to ask if i am the owner of the line, the one who is paying for the internet services, i played along and said yes as my mum wasn't home. i had asked what is this regarding a couple of times throughout the phone call, he would simply reply there is an issue with your internet broadband sir. The next thing he wanted me to do was get on my computer, give him remote access to it and he wanted to ""Verify"" i'm the owner by logging into my internet banking account and show him the statements of which i have made the payment in previous months. Immediately i told him i would not do so and if need be i will go down to a Singtel retailer shop to clarify the issue. right after i said that he just hung up on me, without saying another word.

I received a call saying that they caller was from ica and that the call was a 3 way call with the ica rep, surveillance team and me.
They said that i am being deported out of singapore due to indian consulate making a claim of some criminal offence against my name. When i said i know this is a phishing call. The caller (guy 1) got aggressive and started to threaten me that he will send the cops to where-ever i am. 

They collected my nric, passport number, my house address, how many bank accounts i have and the amount of money i have in it. Which incidentally is negligible and then they started asking me if i had credit cards.
And then the line was pass to division officer (guy 2) who said threatened to deport me again and then gave me 3 options to choose from quoting clause 18 a, 18 b and 20a. 20a required that i pay a fine of 5000 sgd. I said i do not have the money and then they said without that i would be sent back.

When i agreed to pay the guy 2 asked me to go to a 7-11 and get a google play card worth 5000sgd. After this the line was passed to the 3rd guy who was to take me through the payment process. The 3rd guy first asked me if i had a debit card, to which i said, i had it but i have no money in my bank to use it. He then said please go to the nearest challenger.

At this point i suggested that i go to ica building which is closer to where i was and i can make the payment there. They insisted that i do not do that as i can be detained there and instead go to a challenger. I used the time to walk over to challenger as an excuse to get to the nearest police station and lodge a complaint about it.

They referred to some alien number not updated when i had first entered in singapore and that i would need to update it. And that the ica office would come over to my house to get this number updated.

They refused to let me disconnect the call. And stayed on the call with me for 2 hours plus and during that time if the call would get disconnected they would call me back immediately.

                The call was received 25 feb 2020 at 6:55am and the caller posed as an officer from ""cyber security agency of singapore"" saying that it's about my ip address on the internet. caller had indian accent, and the phone number above was reflected on caller id.

I suggest that the sg police set up an secure online form that is shared with telco providers, so that such telephone numbers can be instantly alerted for scams and reported, to prevent innocent victims from being scammed.

Editor's Note: Scammers are using spoofing technology to create fake numbers and the numbers that appear on users' Caller IDs are often untraceable, defunct, or belong to some innocent parties. Instead of focussing on the numbers, the more effective solution is to learn how to identify a scam call. In the above case, the one clear red flag is for an Agency to call a resident at random and asking for her IP address.

She said she has information regarding my singtel internet connection. i don't have a singtel connection, to which  she said singtel runs all the internet infrastructure in singapore (ok!!)
She said singtel has information that someone (hackers!) are trying to connect with with my PC and that it is unsafe and they can steal all my data and bank information....she said i can verify this through the netstat command on my windows command prompt (which i typed in and show local address, foreign address...blah blah).
next she said she verify all these connections by connection to singtel server and she will guide me through the process (yea right!)
at that point, i asked to her stop and i'm not interested and if there is a serious threat, you can ask singtel to write to me formally...not over a phone call.

I was contacted by Thomas via a new dating app known as The League. The League apparently does a background verification on everyone's profile by checking with social media platforms like facebook, linkedin and instagram.
Anyway Thomas reached out to me via the app after we matched on Feb 10, 2020 and I responded on 14th. His dating profile suddenly disappeared right after we exchanged numbers so i am unable to view his league profile anymore but he resurfaced again on whatsApp after a few days, Feb 15. He claims he is local Singaporean Chinese who spent quite a number of years in the UK (both studies and work) and that he lives in Pinnance Duxton here in Singapore. He is apparently, working in the petroleum industry and is due to travel tomorrow to Kiev, Ukraine for work soon.  We have been talking to each other via whatsapp for the past 9 days. However my instincts tells me something isn't right. When he started h he was very chill and laid back, saying he wants to take his time and since he is away for business that would give us more time to get to know each other virtually until his return.
What is odd about him is after just chatting for a few days, that he started sharing about his secret wish for me to fly to Kiev with him, assuming if we had met earlier. His m.o. completely changed drastically from Sat, Sun to recently and he started talking about having years to spend time with me and to understand me, stating that my happiness was his utmost priority in life. He even proclaim that he has even deleted his dating profile at The League to solely focus on me and his work. This is all singing a different tune from the weekend where he wanted to take things slow because he was burnt badly from his past relationships.
This morning, i decided to do a test and called his Whatsapp number. It was an automated voice to say that this number is uncontactable and invalid. I confronted him when he texted me over lunch today and he got all weird and upset. He even accused me of being a crazy woman to call him out of the blue and making assumptions that he is a fake.
  Just wanted to see if anyone has seen him on any other dating apps/social platform and also be warned not to be duped.
I have not lost anything just time and some personal info that is not important. Pls do not continue the conversation after realising that the person is a scammer.

the final straw came when he's called to indonesia all of a sudden as a building he erected COLLAPSED, was beaten up by locals and needed to pay eur50,0000 in compensation. His bank account was frozen, managed to borrow some money from his lawyer and needed help to make up the remaining 6k eur within 48h or face jail charge. A complete nonsense.


Have since blocked his contact & saw others reporting the same story here for around the same period. raising awareness that this scammer is still at large on cmb!!

                First, they will msg you and call you to ask you to pick up loans. Its kinda weird when u search on the net for loans and they have your number when you put on the website for enquiry. 

Seems like they shared the same database. They will ask you to take up attractive loans and tell you that they couldn't transfer you and ask you to make a small loan to activate your account. Its a never ending thingy. Go to legal moneylender is better

                I received a call by a lady with a slight indian accent claiming to be from singtel. (the voice was a bit weird, like it was slightly COMPUTERIZED?)
the lady was calling me regarding singtel broadband services. I told her i wasn't using singtel. She went on to say that she ""knew"" and that ""did you know that all broadband services go through singtel broadband? m1,starhub, etc."" then she started going on about how they receive all my private data through notifications, and how the current broadband i use was not safe or secure. this happened when i was at work, and i was lazy to entertain them, so i just hung up.

I have recently started to use Lazada to buy online. Usually i would receive sms from lazada to inform me of my online purchase delivery. Two days ago, i received a sms from lazada informing that i am a winner of their January lucky draw. Since it was the same SMS that Lazada used to inform me of delivery, i did not suspect it will be a scam until i clicked the link. The link led me to a survey and questions seems legit. Next it prompted me to select the color of the phone. Then delivery option either ninja van or singpost. Ninja is free whilst singpost cost $2. Naturally i chose ninja but it says it is not available. Thus i need to use singpost and pay the $2. Then i was lead to provide my credit details. At this stage, i became suspicious and decided not to complete the transaction until i verified with lazada if this is a genuine promotion. I was informed by Lazada that this is a scam and that they have received high volume of report. What puzzle me is there is no such warning in lazada site nor did they report about a hack on their website. Obviously my personal details have been given. But 2 days have passed, but no report or action from Lazada.

Like a fool i forwarded the requireD documentS - IC BACK AND FRONT, passport ID, BANK ACCOUNT DETAIL AND NEXT OF KIN CONTACT. Jeff, the man on the phone, said company will transfer $500 and I have To do an $800 transfer - to ensure smooth transaction between myself and co & to show that I have $ to pay. That was the start of me wanting to cancel. Then I ask for some form of Id, which i did not get. That was when I knew it was a scam. I cancelled my request. Again and again. Jeff ignored my request and proceeded to transger the $500. Shocked, i made a police report. Went to my baNk to return the money to the above sender. Everything is in process as I am typing this!!


They will ask you to do a direct transfer saying it is faster. Dont. Let the bank handle this.


I hope They will not disturb me ever again. Please, never send your private info over the phone!!! Now they have my address.


i have alerted my home security people at the guardhouse and hook up with the police for Security. My neighbours roughly know the Situation and are on alert. Thank goD we look out for one ANother here. I have camera placed where i need to, connected to an alarm. At the press of a button and help is on its way, the first person being all your next door neighbours. They are the most important people aT time like this.

                Received an automated/ recorded message from a local landline number (+65 6898 9295) from 'Singapore State High Court' informing me that i have failed to appear in court for a summons and to press 5 to speak to an officer about the case.  I pressed 5 and was transferred to somebody pretending to be from the high court and they requested me to confirm my name and IC in order to provide details of the summons (which i was completely not aware about).  i told them i would not provide my name for personal data security reasons, and they then said it is important and i should make an urgent appointment at the high court at Havelock square to be provided with if i do not want to provide my IC over the phone.  It was 8.30am on Monday and i was about to reach the office so reluctantly confirmed my name and IC (and nothing else).

I was then told a story about a summons for a phone bill unpaid for 2 years.  i was then told the fake number and that the phone was registered in my name.  I was then told there was a connected case being investigated by China Interpol.  this was regarding a suspect named Tan Fue Yi who had been detained in Beijing with a bundle of ATM cards and one of them has my name on it.   i was told she is suspected of money laundering and that i should cooperate with Singapore Interpol to clear my name and help the Chinese with their investigation.  

I was then given a case number and transferred to supposedly Interpol where an officer introduced himself as officer CAVIN who requested me to confirm my IC and name and provide case number and details of the case (the story I'd just been told)  in order to record my version of events for the record.  

He then requested to meet him at Interpol with my IC and passport to sign my report and for him to escort me to the Chinese embassy to assist investigations.  again this was urgent and he suggested i try to meet him within the hour.  about 90 minutes later I arrived at Interpol to be informed there is no officer Cavin and to report this scam to the local police.

""FINAL WARNING!
You have 46 Hours in order to make the payment. (I have a Facebook pixel in this email, and at this moment I know that you have read through this email message). If I do not get the Bitcoin, I will certainly send out your files and video recording to all your contacts including relatives, coworkers and all contacts. Having said that, if I receive the payment, I'll destroy all files and videos immediately. If you need evidence, reply with ""Yes"" and I will certainly send out your video recording to your 6 contacts. It is a non-negotiable offer, Don't waste my personal time and your by responding to this message.

I'm a Hacker who cracked your devices. I set up a malware on the adult video (p0rn) website and guess what, you visited this site to have fun (you know what I mean). While you were watching videos, your internet browser started out functioning as an ""HRDP"" Hidden Remote Desktop Protocol which gave me accessibility to your screen and web camera. After that, my software program obtained all your contacts and files.

What did I do?
I generated a backup of your every system (private document files, video, photos, all files). I created a double-screen video. 1st part shows the video you were watching (you've got a good taste hahaha), and 2nd part shows the recording of your webcam. All your data is already uploaded to a remote server. Do not try to contact me. Various security services will not help you; formatting a disk or destroying a device will not help either since your data is already on a remote server.

Exactly what should you do?
Well, in my opinion, 500 (USD) Dollars is a fair price for our little secret. You'll make the payment by Bitcoin (search ""Bitcoin Wallet"" in Application Store then Download and Install it) Make a deposit to your wallet. After that, transfer it to my wallet.

Ordered two razor refills on 23rd nov 2019 due to replacement urgency. On 5th dec 2019, seller confirmed no stock to ship and thus order was cancelled. I was told refund will take no more than 14 working days. After more than 14 working days, no refund in sight. Followed up with seller several times, they give excuses that they have refund system problem but no date of payment committed. Eventually, i gave them an option to ship item (which should have stock by now in feb 2020) or refund, they simply ignore my messages and never reply since then. I researched online and found that there are many other victims cheated by this seller as well. Beware and don't ever buy from carethy.net.

                I picked up a call from +65 9761 4353

What i heard was an automated call from 'DBS' saying that my account had noted some unusual activities. It was in both english and mandarin. It then said to press 3 to speak to someone. After a short while, a man (sounded young, 20s - 30s) picked up the phone and spoke in mandarin. He did not immediately pretend to be DBS, but asked me what's the matter. I spoke to him in English saying that i received a call that said my DBS account had some unusual activities. He apologized and said his was a chinese speaking center, and asked if i speak Chinese.

I then basically (calmly, as an advice) told him not to do bad things and that there is karma. I could tell he got a little upset and told me 'you are the one that is a' (in chinese) 'scam' (in english, pronounced 'se-cam'). I didn't even use that word on him. Anyway I hung up after that, but wanted to report and share the phone number (as it was a scam number)

I met him on instagram. Within 3 days, he said he is interested in me, in pursuing marriage if it worked out. He claimed to be widower with a 4-yr-old girl, a Singaporean whose parents migrated to the states before he was born. Currently based in San Diego, but he intends to relocate here by the end of the year. About two weeks after we chatted, I bought him a sim card ($15; the first number indicated) so that he can use WhatsApp, claiming he is offshore (with Keppel) and can't get one. Two days later, he claimed he couldn't receive my messages and he started texted me using another number (the second number indicated). But there was still records of the other number being online. Then he asked me to get an iTunes card for him. All thanks to this website that I know he's a scammer. I said I might have cancer and he called me immediately. Very nice and smooth but his African accent was another giveaway. I used the sim card on my phone and found that he was using that number to WhatsApp someone else, who said that he even claimed to have a house at Yishun! Please be wary and vigilant when making friends online!

thn the next day, he claim tat sent by EXPRESSES and told me i have to pay some fee when parcel arrive. he also said he put 45000 pound in the parcel cos he want to use it when he visit singapore.
i was shock, in my mind, as a high educated engineer, why can he put money inside the parcel? he DOESN'T know that it will confiscated by custom. and NOWADAYS, the credit card is convenient to bring oversea, why must put the pounds in the parcel, was him crazy?
and in the afternoon time, a guy with malaysia phone number text me said the things from london to me need clearance and i have to pay clearance fee at S$4200 as the things overweight at 35kg? 
S$4200 for clearance??? what is the thing inside and it weight more than 35kg? 
i asked the uk guy, he said is a surprise and asked me to settle with the delivery man immediately since there is 45k pound in the parcel, so i request the delivery man to send me the photo of the parcel, i want to see how huge is the parcel.  but he refuse to send me and said he has no right to do it. and asked to do the only cash deposit to his dbs personal account.
the  'uk' guy said the gift is worth more than 1k pound but i have to pay S$4200 clearance fee, and the gifts was stuck in malaysia custom. he said i can get back the money when i received the parcel. he keep calling me for several times, but i told him i was in meeting, and he asked again my address, search for me the nearby atm and asked me to bank in to the delivery guy immediately, i told him i was busy, will bank in later after work, but he keep calling, i refuse to answer and just text him said i was busy..
then i have blocked both of the delivery man number and this uk guy number immediately.
1) never believe people said they put money in the parcel
2) no matter how express, delivery from other countries at least 3 days 
3) delivery company must have company bank account and company phone number and will always able to check the parcel
4) no allow bank transfer must be something wrong
5) parcel from uk to singapore but why have to do clearance in malaysia?

I was very puzzled on the development of this relationship but nevertheless felt good to have sweet nothings everyday. on 24 jan, he told me that his worker has accidentally caused damage to a machinery control panel and the panel needed to be replace urgently. the cost of the control panel is USD 45k and there is an outstanding balance of USD 3k that he would like me to transfer the money over to him. he was even willing to pay me back double next week after his fund reached him. He even sent me the invoice that clearly shown the outstanding balance. Immediately, i can tell that the invoice is a fake one. i told david that i will not transfer the money to him and block him immediately. my loss in this case was my previous time and emotions.

                1) how it happened?
Received a call in the morning from a lady with an indian accent, lots of background noise (sounded like a call centre). Claimed that she is from singtel and that they have detected some problems with my internet connection. throughout the call she asked me more than once if i was the main user and owner. she then asked me to check how many lights are lit up on my router and what kinds of devices are connected to my internet. she then transferred me to a man who introduced himself with a Caucasian name and started out speaking in an American accent. he asked me to look at my computer, tell him what key was next to the control key (to determine if i was using a Mac or PC), then made me access the command terminal. He then tried to tell me what to type in it (clearly to hack me). when i asked if i can do this some other time he started get a bit hostile and raised his voice (and his accent changed to an indian accent) asking me if i knew what this was for and that i said i knew what this was for earlier. i said yes i know but why can't i do this some other time? then he hung up.

2) When it happened

                i was attracted to a message saying i could borrow 10k with a repayment for 60mths. so i was curious and texted the number to enquire. and very quickly someone by the name of TH responded and said in order to start the process, he will bank in 500 into my account and then in  return, i was to transfer 800 to them in a couple of  days, this is to set up the account and show some kind of track record. he asked for an a picture of my IC front and back . and a screenshot of my cpf contributions. a video call was then made to verify i am the person showing on the ic but their screen was blocked out so i couldnt see who i was dealing with . it didnt feel right and i looked up the registry of licensed moneylenders and found their name on the list. i was also convinced to borrow more, the amount would be 30k because my cpf showed that i was earning a significant amount. it was 550x 60mths, this was a loan that was as good as my renovation loan and it seemed really attractive.  3 days later, i received the call and i sent 800, they were about to process the loan and told me everything was ready and it was ready to be dispersed, i was then told to transfer 1680 as a transaction fee. that was when i knew it was a fake. i told them i didnt have the money and cannot transfer that amount and i didnt want to take the loan anymore, they said, not to worry and sent me an agreement letter. to show that everything was legitimate but the legal document once again did not look right and i told them, no, i did not want the loan. i was then threatened and was told i have to pay a cancelation fee of 20%, which did not make sense when i did not sign anything. he kept threatening and said once this is cancelled, it will be handled by a different department and he wouldn't know how they will handle this. i kept insisting that i did not want the loan and he said he will call me back. i have since blocked their number. and reported it to the police.

                i received a call on 10 feb 2020 4 pm from a man with indian accent who claims to be from singtel. according to him, he claims that my internet security has been compromised and will require me to go through some steps to check on this and block these foreign ip users who has been using my internet. He says he know this because of the high data consumption (70% more) these few days.


He then proceeded to guide me to type cmd on my run window box. I became suspicious and asked him why is singtel calling me when i am using m1. then he said that singtel is the main telco provider for all other broadband services in singapore. unconvinced, i said i am too busy to do this as i have work to do. he offered to call me back tomorrow morning which i declined. so i asked him, why go through so much trouble when i can just cancel the internet subscription now?


upon hearing this, he immediately hanged up the phone.

I initially saw the advertisement on Facebook and was tempted by the price offered by the scammer. Out of curiosity, I visited their site and contacted the seller via whatsapp. He asked for an immediate bank transfer and promised a delivery within 90 minutes. Guided by greed and desire for the product, I transferred the money ($220) to him on the 3rd of February. However, i did not receive the product in the time frame promised. The scammer then forged an email using the name of fastfastdelivery and sent it to me, requesting for another $300 transfer for gst and insurance charges. I realised I was scammed. Using this platform, I would like to urge everyone to think twice before performing an online transaction. 
Some deals are too good to be true and hence, pls do your research before purchasing from an online seller.

Met john on Bumble mid Dec. He is a petroleum engineer, singaporean who lost parents moved to us. Moving back to sg to start his own oil company. Ex-girlfriend cheated on him, he focused on his career, now successful. We started chatting on Wechat on dec 20. He was awarded a 2 mil contract (showed me the contract) at istanbul, flew there, started working on a rig. Jan 14, cyber attack on the rig, moved conversation to hangout because of internet restriction. His machine broke, asked me to transfer money from his account to supplier to pay for repair. Bank sent him an alert of potential hacker, froze his account, he asked me to help pay for repair. I transferred money to a foreign account on jan 16. Similar things happened, i again helped him. On feb 4, he told me tax officers were on the rig to collect tax, threaten his life if he does not pay. I realized something is amiss, filed a police report. The man made me feel appreciated and loved, he sounded very convincing, understanding, and he volunteered information. I did basic research on the info he provided and they seem legit. Ladies, be careful out there. A guy who said the right thing may not be a real person. Never send money to strangers. Lesson learnt.

Indian lady called on 6 Feb morning and said she’s calling on behalf of Singtel. Feedback that our home router was compromised by people with Foreign IP Addresses and she can help to provide assistance to block them. said she wants to do a survEy, la=ter became technical assistance. Asked me to check my router if it had blinking lights. If it is, thEn security is compromised. Then she asked me to Turn on my Laptop so she can show me the steps to get rid of these forEign Ip adds. Then, i purposely hung up thE phone. She called back (different locla number - all starts with +65) 
When i asked for her id, she identified herself as “amy smith”. No offence but this is not a Usual name for an indian Lady with strong Accent. She was insistent and blabbered on when i told her i will verify thiS service with singtel Before i hung up. When i called back on both numbers, Both are invalid. 
Pls take note of the following red flags:-
1) singapore number +65. However, First number is not a mobile or home/business number. It doesN’t start with 8//9 or 6. Mine Was shown as +6536121491. The other one was TRickier. +6561106609. They probably used some software to generate the numbers.
2) Router lights blinking so Security is compromised. Fact is: 1 light Will blink to show that it’s working.
3) i’m a starhub subscriber, why would a singtel staff call me? When questioned, she said singtel is doing this for free as all the telcos are under their umbrella
Hope these info helps

She was being persistent that i should visit her when i was free during the weekend. As soon as the weekend hits, i was supposed to go somewhere else for personal stuff but she was being persistent that i find her during the weekend. So when i went to the location which was at blk 512 bishan . She told she needed my number's so the manager can call me. When the manager call, he asked me to pay using alipay credits through the axs machine by type the qq mail and choose the amount they told me to pay. I obliged. I didn't know something was wrong until i transfer a total of $3300. They even told me borrow from friends when i not enough to pay the amount. I just ignored the calls from them. They started to spam call and message stating that they will hunt me down and mess with my family and work.

Someone named Zhu Lan contacted me on gumtree, appears to be from overseas. In the initial email, the person send me 'her' ic photo which at first seems like a sincere person looking for a room. However, sometimes seems off as she kind of agree to everything very quickly and okay with the room without even coming down to view it personally. 
The person even offered to pay the rent of the first 3 months, as 'she' need to show the employer the proof of rent before she can quit her current oversea job as a cruise chef.
I notice something was off when she asked me to register for a paypal account, its the way the email was structured like it was meant to send as a mass phishing email scam. The next thing was the whatsapp number 'she' provide was a +63 philippines number.
Afterward i did a search on her name, it indeed was a scam as other fellow singaporean already encountered this same person few months ago.
I only lost my paypal email , name and phone number information. I just hope to bring awareness to other people renting room to be careful of this particular scam. 
She offered pay 3 months in advance by paypal, but before paying, she will ask you to pay for her mover fee which is around $500 that she will include in the rental fee afterwards.

If someone approaches you to give you months' of rental in advance, be wary!

I received a call via viber apps from this number +923408133885. He said he is calling from dbs bank and my atm card has been blocked. I can not go to any DBS branch to unlock it or online. The only way to unblock is to provide him my particular details.
I told him it's ok and i will go to DBS on the way back home to check personally and hang up the call.

                I received a Viber Call from number 92 3438324947. A man claiming to be from from DBS. He said that if I didn't update my information, my card would be blocked. He tried to send me message via phone but failed so he had to call to verify. Then started to ask like which nationality, etc. But I did not answer.

I very much believe that this is a scam and didn't bother asking which card. 

It's worth to note that he has some of my personal Info: Name, phone number, card start date, etc.

                I ALMOST LOST 11K BY A SCAMMER.

SO guys two days ago I was contacted by an interested buyer that wished to purchase a high-value watch WHICH COSTED 11K. HE CONTACTED ME THROUGH DEPOP AND ASKED ME MY PHONE TO TALK TO WHATSAPP. HE TOLD ME HE WANTED THE WATCH FOR HIS BROTHER’S BIRTHDAY. HE claimed to be WORKING OFFSHORE AND needed the watch in 3 days to be sent to his brother as he would leave for camp in maLAYSIA. U GUYS i was conviNCED thIs it a legit buyer however I did google his number and username to find almost 20 stories from people that got scammed. he told me to ship it with fedex and after i found out about the scam i told him that fedex could not ship it until next week to avoid him. He then proceeded to send me a screenshot of his transactions which was a complete photoshop picture. He threatened me that I will have problems if I don't send him the watch. I then screen-grabbed the photo and sent him one of the stories that I read here about him  and told him ”would u think i would give my valuable rolex to a scammer? hell no and then blocked him. I would not write this story however I was so close to lose 11k that I want everybody to watch out this guy. Be safe and do not send anything without first claiming you money. i read that he would claimed that the bank needed 1-2 days for the money be reflected in the statement and he would give all sorts of excuses, o just dont send any product before u have the money in your bank account.

I met Philip on the Bumbledate app and we chatted for about 2 months. After chatting for a few weeks, he asked me to use his username and password to log into a bank account because he wanted to check if the client has paid him. Then after a few weeks later, he said he was coming over to Singapore to meet me from Doha which was a transit from Kuwait and showed me a photo of his travel itinerary. On the day of his arrival, I received a phone call from a woman claiming to be from Malaysian customs and she said Philip was being detained at Kuala Lumpur because he brought in excess money and did not declare them. She told me to pay a fine of $5200 on his behalf through a bank transfer. Philip told me that the Malaysian customs had confiscated all of his money and belongings and he could not pay the fine with the money that he had or with a credit card and wanted me to cooperate with them. I called Malaysian customs and they did not detain anyone on that day.

Alex drop me a fb instant message. He mentioned he is a China mix American & worked as an aviation engineer working at a frontier airline. After talking for a few days. He told me he is flying to France to buy parts for his work. When he reached France he told me that he bought me a gift & ask for my address to send the gift over. He also demanded for my contact no, saying that when the package reached Singapore, someone will call me. I knew something was fishy but wanted to see what was he up to. After a few days later he asked if anyone called me regarding his gift, told him “no”. Then he said “Oh, you would like the gift.” 
After a while, I received a Whatsapp message mentioning the package is 26.8kg & i'm required to pay $3.7k to clear Immigration. I confronted him and he tried to call me & said i will receive more than 3.7k because he had couriered cash in the box with his extra funds he received to buy the spare parts from his job. He got annoyed because i don't trust him. I told him off, telling him that I hardly knew him. From there, I blocked him & the local courier agent. (courier service guy told him i'm busy message me instead. He called several times again from a Singapore hp number i ignored the call. But when call back it was an indian national say he never call. The courier guy called himself as Heng from global link logistics & Alex sound like the same person as he have a funny accent)

                i received a call from a hidden number ON CHINESE NEW YEAR EVE 2020. usually i don't pick up calls FROM UNKNOWN NUMBERS but since i was waiting for a delivery, i picked it up. 
there was no one on the other end for almost one minute but i heard voices in the background and some static. after 1 minute, someone said ""hello, I am from the technical department of singtel"". he then went on to say the usual dialogue i've seen in other people's reports here, SUCH AS ""we have received warnings from your ip address, some people are using it to access internet. when you log in to facebook, banks etc they can see your details."" 
tbh, from the moment he said ""singtel"" I knew it was a scam because singtel usually contacts my husband, not me, because i deflect whatever service that requires phone calls to my husband (#introvertproblems) but i decided to play along. i asked him ""where are you from?"" and again he repeated ""FROM THE TECHNICAL DEPARTMENT OF SINGTEL"". then I repeated again, ""where are *you* from?"" (because he also sounded foreign and it was hard to understand his accent) and again he repeated ""fROM THE TECHNICAL DEPARTMENT OF SINGTEL, for three years in singapore"". then i said ""do you have any verification?"" and he said ""yes, you take pen and paper and write down this number and you can verify and you know we are from THE TECHNICAL DEPARTMENT OF SINGTEL"". to which i replied ""and where am I supposed to check this number against??"" THEY ASKED ME TO REPEAT MYSELF AGAIN AND TO SPEAK LOUDER (I SEE THEY'RE PLAYING MY GAME TOO HUH) AND THEN I JUST SAID ""NO I WILL NOT SPEAK LOUDER AND I WILL NOT REPEAT MYSELF I AM BUSY NOW OK BYE BYE."" 

WHILE ON THE PHONE I WAS ALSO ON WEB WHATSAPP AND MESSAGING MY HUSBAND TO CHECK WITH HIM, WHICH WAS WHY I DECIDED TO PLAY ALONG WITH THE SCAMMER'S PHONE CONVERSATION. MY HUSBAND WHO IS FROM THE IT DEPARTMENT OF HIS COMPANY ALSO SAID, IF THERE'S ANYTHING WRONG WITH WHATEVER SERVICE, THE CUSTOMER SERVICE DEPARTMENT WILL BE THE ONE TO CALL YOU -- NEVER IT/TECHNICAL DEPARTMENT! 
HOPE THIS STORY HELPS SOMEONE!

Editor's Note: Pls end a call if you find it suspicious and call the company's official number to verify the identity of the caller. The Singtel tech support impersonation scam is an ongoing scam, hence, pls beware of this scam.

                I got this call few times from different number. He/SHe claimed he is from sIngtel technical dept. He said someone access my home internet last few days illegally. He told me to connect my pc and will guide me along to reset the wifi. I asked him to provide his employee ID and name so I will call singtel home line to verify. He only gave me so call 'security customer id'. I doubted the number so I told him that i will rather call singtel directly. He still refused to give me his employee id and cut off the line. I got few similar calls on last few months. 

The best response to such calls - End them.

                I received a phone call on 15 Jan at 10:54am. When I picked up the call, I heard a pre-recorded recording of a person claiming to be an ICA Officer. I put down the phone around 10 seconds and did not respond in any way. When I tried to return the call using a landline, there was a ringing tone but no one picked up. I believe this is a scam number and would like to alert others.

                he (james hee) messaged me on ig, wanted to make friends with a Singaporean.  Claimed his parents migrated from Singapore to USa (Colorado springs), he wanted to come back to Singapore.  claimed he's a marine engineer trying to win a contract from Keppel corp.  he called, don't sound like an American, very strong accent, I cut off the voice call and tried to call him back with video call, he covered his camera, pretty sure he's not real, cos the photos he sent seemed to be taken professionally.  Chatted for a while with him as he said he's coming over to Singapore to get the contract, claimed he needed $5500 to pay for his accommodation in Singapore in order to win the contract, but his agent ran out of cash to pay for him.  he asked me for help to pay $4000 on his behalf as bank transfer needs 5 to 7 working days.  he didn't succeed the first time, told him I have no money.  2nd time asked for $7500.  send me fake flight details, awarded certificate, too many loopholes.  almost believed him, but he didn't bother to do his homework.  caught too many clues to confirm he's a scammer.  didn't lose anything, sharing the story for everyone to look out....

                I responded to a text msg which offer loans for a very low interest rate and over 5 years. the person is johnny who claimed to be from sal credit pte ltd. i enquired for a loan, johnny urged me to submit my personal details that is front and back of ic, cpf contribution and singpass. due to my financial situation, i am in need of money to settle my family expenses. Thus, all info was submitted via whatapps. subsequently the so called loan was approved even though during the application, i asked to cancel the application, they didn't allow. 

another administrator named ryan called to inform to pay 7% GST of the loan amount in order for the loan to be deposited into my account. This was when i felt something amiss and i went to search for information on the company and called ministry of law for clarification. and i was sadly informed that this SAL credit pte ltd is not a legit money lender. 

thereafter, johnny whatapps me again with threats of fire burning house hold videos and claiming that he will pay me a visit at my place within the day. 

it is a horrid experience. so please do look out for such scams.

                I am a victim of loan scam. I actually did contact the licensed money lender Power Credit to enquire on a business loan and coincidentally received a text from a guy who confirmed he is from the company Power Credit.

I had made several transfers as they harass me during my work and claiming the transaction was not approved because I put in the wrong information etc.

I had since lost $5k .

The following are my transactions:

I have paid:

1) $1000 ( UOB 3633052466) on 5 Jan 2029 ($700 +$300) $700 was transfer to my account and I had to return $1k

After (1) transaction, they said not accepted as I put the wrong remarks and forces me to transact again.  I had no choice as I was working and the constant call they ring me dozen times...I was promised once done, there will be no more fees.  I was instructed to put ""CLEAR DANNIS""

2) $1000 ( UOB 3633052466) on 5 Jan 2029 (clear Dannis) 

Then I was harnessed to pay $1500 Admin fee upfront. As I had exceeded the limit to transfer for that day , they said that he can accept $1000. 

3) $1000 (UOB 455  394 8872) on 5 Jan 2020 -()Admin Fee)

After the (3) transaction had been done, he claim their accounts do not accept and then asked me to transfer $1500 and they will refund me when the loan is given out. I told them I will want out from the loan but they harness and said they need that amount to close the case.

4) $1500 (UOB 3633052466)final Admin Fee, I had used my corporate account to transfer as I had no other means...Again I was they received mony but not accepted as it is not a personal.account.

I am given two days until 8 Jan to clear this $1500.

I am.always careful but because I did contact the licensed lender and the confidence, I lost my bearings and fall into trap.

The team consist of three men but I think they sound the same.  The address themselves as Dannie (the staff), Martin (the boss) and Kenny (the accountant) . The mobile number is 84199936.

                I saw a loan Advertisement on Facebook and click interested. Shortly after, a man named lexus WhatsApp me to ask more details eg. Loan amount, salary, ic, cpf statements.  He mentioned he will process the application and let me know soonest. Within 1 hour, he called to say that the loan is approved. He Whatsapp a screenshot of the transfer into my account. However, when I checked, the amount was not in. I called him and he mentioned that I need to put in an advance payment of $1040 1st before he can release the funds. I made the transfer  and he mentioned that i need to pay another $1000 for GST and admin fee. That's when i realised i have been scammed.

I felt weird but he gave excuses and he produced IC and workpass (which was fake). In the end agreed to pay deposit of $150 first and the balance upon delivery and seller assured its refundable. after some time he called and said his boss needed full payment before delivery. i suspected something wasn't right and requested to cancel transaction and refund. he became aggressive and insisted i transfer the remaining balance. i refused and asked for refund. he never replied since.

Said he based in america from texas and lives in both places, da nang in vietnam as well. Noticed that his cute mom , sister and siblings lives in america and he has to visit them at weekends( that's how he explained his disappearing for 1,5-2 days). He was always extremly polite, always showering with sweet words. Didn't tell about himself much, always claimed he is super busy.

So the day came when he send me photo of luxury gifts he bought for me but i said i can't take them but he insist because in this way he wanted to show how much she loves and cherish me..asked for my home address.

After this he started to say things to make me feel quilt!!! I blocked him everywhere. After this i found a real person which photos of he was using and confirmed that profile is fake.

Received a Whatsapp message regarding loan tenures at a lower interest rate on the 29th dec 2019. My husband was showed interest for 50k loan and at this point we didn't suspect anything fishy. Since my husband is self employed, he(jonathan) needed my pay slip and also my ic details. We sent him. Being a sunday, the loan was cleared within 1 hr at about 9pm. Jonathan claimed that he was working overtime and that is how he was able to get our loan approved so fast. He was even willing to meet us up immediately to get the so call documents signed but before that he wanted to confirm our bank account whether it belongs to us and immediately transferred us $500 which came from sender alan. Then he wanted us to transfer him $1k which will be refunded back upon signing the documents. So i transferred him $1k with the recipient name alan and sender as my name to given ocbc account number. Jonathan watsapp call to said that we put the wrong name and wanted us to transfer another $1k with the correct name. At this point we knew something was not right and we questioned him. Jonathan asked the admin guy ( ivan) to contact us. Ivan was asking us to transfer 1k or we will have to pay a cancellation fee (10%) of the amount to be borrowed. This was not even mentioned to us in the begining. We knew this was a scam and made a police report on the same night itself. We lost a total of $500. Pls pls never ever respond to and text or watsapp messages regarding loans. These people are scammers. They cant even speak proper english and onlu uses watsapp message and calls to communicate with you.

I got to know Jerry Cheung via coffee meets bagel app and chatted with him daily for 3 weeks. Jerry introduced himself as a singaporean raised in moscow as he was adopted by a russian at a young age. He said he has been living in Singapore for 8 months and he is waiting for licence approval to set up his company in singapore. He introduced his occupation as an architect.
Jerry will shower you with lots of attention and professes his love, saying that he feels strongly connected to you even before he met you. You will think that everything sounds normal as Jerry shares his daily photos with you (e. G. Gym, food), updating you of his whereabouts etc. He also set a time to meet though not immediate as he said he had to return to moscow for work one week into the chat. 
Two weeks after chatting, one day, he said he had to rush to Indonesia as one of the building he erected collapsed. During investigation, his passport was seized by his client and he was hit by his client, injured and had to go to the hospital.
I was half believing when i heard the story, but thank god my friend told me about this site and i found a few reports here with exact/almost similar plot. I blocked him on line since then even before he could ask me for money. 
To all the girls out there, please be aware of this person who might use the same story line to con others.

I was re-directed to an officer telling me that I had a package detained at the Chinese customs, containing illegal items-1 jacket, 6 credit cards. I denied any connection to the parcel He then proceeds to tell me he would transfer my call to local police at Shanghai so that I can make a police report.
The second person I spoke to transfer the call again to another police office because it was a foreign case. 

A third person, then told me to google his phone number to verify that he was indeed a Chinese police officer. I check the number. It turned up in Google search results as the number to the Shanghai Feng Xian district police station. 
This convinced me the call was authentic. 

He then sent over a picture of a police warrant card, which made me believe even more that the case was real and I started to feel scared. 

The person requested my Chinese identity card no and home address and to record a statement in private. 

The recording of the statement took place over Whatsapp. 
The person revealed on the call that I was further implicated in a more serious case that was confidential and I could not let anyone else know. 
The person told me  a man called Mr Lu Jian was suing me for fraud and money laundering, and that my arrest warrant will to be issued and be detained for 45 days and assets frozen immediately.

I was scared. The person asked if I would cooperate with them or be arrested by international police. I agreed to work with them out of shock.

They monitored me every movement, to message them every 3 hours and not to not to tell the details to my family and other person to keep confidentiality. 
I had to inform them and no matter what time of the day it was, someone would always reply. 
They then asked me for all my bank account details so that they can check if I am involved the money laundering.

A robocall informs me of a DHL package, then asks me to press 3 for more info. I did， then a man appears and told me i have a package detained at the Chinese customs, containing illegal items. He then proceeds to tell me he would transfer my call to local police at guangdong. Then the phone transfers to another man who claims to be police, ask me to confirm their number on a fake police website and asks me to find somewhere quiet and do not tell anyone so he can take a police record. I finally realize something is off and hang up.

                Scammer creates profiles on tinder, line & facebook . Pretends to be interested in you and so on and so forth and is based in Hong Kong but comes from China.

SHAREs photos of themselves as well as a good background story. (Very convincing)

Pretends to help you by giving you inside information on investments via cryptocurrency and is willing to walk you through it. (Red flag but I carried on with it to learn more about the scam)

Showed me a white paper document on a very recent cryptocurrency. (Very important is that you read the document and Google the information as well as the team leading it.)

I use various platforms for research AND got in CONTACT with FRIENDS from the BANKING industry as well as intel from a cryptocurrency trader. Conclusion is that it might be a scam using the pump & dump method. All the team members featured in the white paper do not exist after using facial recognition search and industry background search. Certain information written seemed off when reviewed by CRYPTOCURRENCY veterans.

Scammer instructed me to use Huobi app to exchange fiat currency to USDT. After that using the USDT to deposit into Ruibtc trading site. I did An internet trustworthiness check on both and came up with not much issues. Huobi is valid and security seems good with a large amount of traders using it. Ruibtc was a bit suspicious so I did a test and transacted a small amount between both platforms TO test the legitimacy of it. Ruibtc passed as well. That only meant the CRYPTOCURRENCY was the problem. By encouraging investors to buy in and push value up and once that happens the scammers in control of the CRYPTOCURRENCY would dump/sell all of their units making the later investors lose their investments.

I did additional searches on Facebook and tinder and found the same person with a different name. All posts were recently made.

This is one of the most elaborate scams I have come across. (DHL, SPF, singpost are ALL 3rd rate scams)

Halfway through she caught on to what I was doing but still pretended to be innocent. (I doctored a few of the screenshots and the scammer NOTICED the numbers did not tally lol)

Now the question is, are those photographs of childhood and events a stolen identity or are they confident enough to use their own profiles to scam knowing that the government would not be able to track them down?

I have further DOCUMENTATIONs if needed. 

Always remember do not run from scams, TRY if possible to find out as much information as possible without revealing much of your own. Come up with your own back story. If we don't learn how they operate we will always be outdated.

Oh I did lose $70+ due to transactional fees and exchange rates BUT the case study was fascinating. THANK you.

                I saw an ad at facebook and got interested.

after engaging via the contact details provided, was requested for my i.c (both sides), income statement and bank account number..

after enquiring, they also stated that there is no need to come down to their site to fill up any forms or signatures (since everything will be done online).

then they stated that it's required to make ""loan record"" since i'm a 1st time customer, which amounts to SGd 380 ($180 from me and 200 from them), which will be refunded along with the loan.

after agreeing, they transferred the $200 to my bank account and i made the 'loan record'.

it started to get awry when at first the funds was transferred 'to the wrong bank account' and i was required to make transfer of $380 again #with the same format as mentioned above to make another 'loan account'.

ultimately, after making a transfer of the same amount and format as mentioned above to their 'gm' and 'shareholders', there was no confirmation of any loan+refund.

He refused to send me documents claiming that the company on uses whatsapp for faster communication. He asked that I send him $1000. I felt something was wrong so i told him i am no longer INTERESTED. I called credit max to look for him only to be tol by the lady that ""Lester"" is a scammer and i need to call the police right away. Lesson learned, only trust banks for loans. not anyone else. Banks are there for a reason.

Was talking to her normally, until she mention her services.after i mention where i stay. she was being persistent that i should visit her when i was free during the weekend. As soon as the weekend hits, i was supposed to go somewhere else for personal stuff but she was being PERSISTENT that i find her during the weekend. So when i went to the location which was at blk 532 ang mo kio. she told she needed my number so the manager can call me. when the manager call, he asked me to pay using alipay credit. i obliged. i DIDN'T know something was wrong until i transfer a total of $2700. after i fed up that the person WASN'T showing up,. i just IGNORED the calls from them. they started to spam call and message stating that they will hunt me down and mess with my family. while the girl was trying to convince me why i should pay up as it part of their ""Quota"" which is stupid as to why it was not mention at all. So if you got numbers that are from +852 and +34, they are most likely not in Singapore.

He started asking for money (on 15 Dec) to bid for his oil rig contract at Turkey. He need US$100K to purchase machinery and he has only US$ 82K in hand and asking me for the balance. If I am unable too, he wants me to lend him US$ $10K. I have google the ScamAlert, found out many similar cases. Told him I don't have money. then he lower from US$10K to US$5K.


""David"" did send me the bank details, invoice and his passport. The passport’s his birthday is wrong (He may be forgot he did tell his birthday). On 16 Dec, I have blocked him. good that I already feel somethings is not right, never transfer $ to him.


now, He has registered himself at dating app singles50 using the name “Dave”


These scammer, they are using other people photo to registrate themselves dating app. Don’t even believe the video recording of themselves if they send it to you.
Ask for Live Video chat.

                the scammer started to advertise their cheap tv product in shopee with a footnote saying for serious buyers to watsapp @ +65 8250 7548. they asked to transfer the payment to them outside of shopee account which i didn't agree. They then started to ask me for code that was sent to my mobile. it was from lazada. with this message ""XXXXX is your OTP for your lazada seller account registration. it will expired in 5 mins. do not share under any circumstances!

the scammer tried to use my mobile to set up seller account in lazada so that they can scam others when they advertise for cheap tv and asking interested buyers to transfer them the money outside of the online shopping site. When the buyer contact the online shopping site, the stolen phone number will be used to track and the victim will become the scammer.

She reveals to me that he had conned her of thousands of dollars. how it happens? the package that is on its way, will be stuck at customs. in order to have that package released, a fee of over 5000usd will have to be paid. the same day, anthony tells me that he receives a notification that the parcel should arrive at my mailing address. he asks if i received a notification. i request for more information, a tracking number or for him to forward the notification he has to my email. he refuses, insisting that he merely handed the parcel to a courier agent. he tells me to check. i tell him that things get lost in the post all the time and i have yet to receive anything. in the meantime, the girl that has so gratefully highlighted him as a scammer to me tells me the details of how she got conned. he will tell her to handle the customs, pay what the customs needs to release the package. when asked what was inside the parcel, he says that its a hermes bag worth thousands of dollars. long story short, this girl paid the initial fee of 5000usd to a personal bank account of another name. after that, she is told that more money is needed as it was found that there are additional taxes to be paid. ]

Met him in TanTan. Then we keep in contact via whatsapp. He is very fast in saying he loves me.
He never asked things about me and dont shared much about himself except that he is divorced with no kids, his ex-wife cheated on him, his relatives all died, his father is singaporean and mother is us citizen. That is why he landed in us. He said he is 43 (1976), aries, graduated with degree in civil engineering (2nd upper class) and master with business finance. He also does alot of investment in forex trading. And he invested >85% of his money in estates and forex trading so he has more money to migrate back and be with me. He does not know how to speak chinese yet his english and grammar is average level. 
He asked for my email address saying he wants me to read his document but i rejected. I asked him for video call and he did only once and it is very fake. After that he never do it again even i asked him many times. Always said he is very busy.
Last straw is he said he won a contract with keppel shipyard and technology centre. Showing me 2 pics of the contract cert and award session. So far we exchanged pics of each other, that is, his will be all fakes then.. Will block him after this.

                I received a WhatsApp message with attractive loan package. 5k for 20months @ $275. I send them my IC and payslip loan approved in few hours but there is a clause they will need to pay a loan tax of $200. They transfer $500 3 days later transfer back $500 + $200. I believe in them. 3 days down the road I find in very suspicious. Call the mobile no. ""Not in used"" ask them for office number they mention all contact by WhatsApp. I have transferred back the amount of $500. Now they keep messaging asking for the interest of $200 changing their statement to test loan and scold vulgarities and all types of threaten warning.

- When I asked what is the issue and what can i help him with, his first question was to ask if I was home, and subsequently if i could switch on my computer so that he could show me what exactly is the problem.
- I asked him again what exactly is the issue, and whether he could explain to me what is happening and he says that there are intruders accessing my home internet and he needs me to switch on my computer so as to help him to solve the issue.
- At this point, i know that it is probably a scam, i pretended i've switch on the computer and asked what is next. The 'technician' required me to open the 'command prompt' within my Windows OS.
- He then proceeded to say that he has to now ""transfer"" the call to his colleague to assist me further on what i need to do
- I hanged up the phone at this juncture.
- However, i believe they will either 1) ask me to provide them with my IP address so that they could remotely access my terminal or 2) they are likely getting me to connect to their server some way and some how.

After showing us her workpermit and the conversation she had with the UML, it was clear that there was no transaction made when my helper had decided to forgo the borrowing but they demanded a 'cancellation FEE' of $200 which we refused to give. This was despite the fact that no acct number were given to the other PARTY hence they could not transfer anything but our personal number and address was compromised.  Despite Police report were MADE, They have been harassing us via whatsapp ever SINCE.  I urge everyone not to accept any sweet deals from WHATSAPP loan scam and do not release any personal particulars to channels of unknown.

After everything was done, he asked me pay for the accountant money (2 pax) to make the transaction smooth. at this point of time, i told the person I did not have enough money to pay and he insisted me to pay. at this point, i gave up and went HOME and realised i was scammed and did my research online. 
btw, i borrowed Nearly 1k from my friend to do the transaction. 
i regretted my action and Now I HAVE to find ways to pay back my friends the money i borrowed. 

hope you guys can see this story and prevent yourself from any form of scam by scammers!

received a phone call from ""singtel"" officer with a heavy filipino accent. he claims to be a technician from singtel and have detected that my internet connection has been hacked by someone. he instructed me to follow a few steps in my computer to solve the issue. suspecting something amiss, i reverified if he is from singtel and his name. his name sounded a bit suspicious in relation to his tone of his voice and accent. immediately i told him that i will call him back. but he insisted me to follow the steps but i refused and told him to call me back after 5 mins. the call sounded really off, as he called from a mobile phone, the background noise seems like he is by the roadside. i called singtel to verify if the call was genuine and singtel officer told me that singtel would not be calling customers for issues unless we report to them. the officer told me to share this with ScamAlert.

                i found a Taiwanese girl name of meng () on LOCANTO WEBSITE. She was offering sex for VERY CHEAP PRICE FOR $100 2 hours, $200 4 hours WHICH GOT MY INTEREST. I CONTACTED HER TROUGH LINE TO ASK FOR MORE INFORMATION, MAINLY IS wanted to know more about transaction. (because i was very afraid of getting scam) i asked her a few times if it's fine to pay with cash but she ignored them completely. she said she is living at 401 hougang blk 10 so we decided to meet there. after i have reached the hdb flat she asked me to take a picture of the area and guide me to an axs machine through phone call. (no, the one who called me wasn't a man, i believe is her herself, with taiwanese accent) i suspected it was a scam when she told me to purchase rmb500 alipay credit. the reason she came out with is she is a student and offering sex as part time job, paying with money would get catch easily. i hang up the call and did research on the spot about alipay scamming and found out a lot of men encountered the same experience, even the pricing and technique are exactly the same. i only spent $16 for taking grab to her location in the whole incident.

                On a Friday afternoon, A buyer from gumtree watsapp me and says that he is interested to buy iPhone 11 pro max from me. he said that he is buying as a birthday gift for his daughter and he is working offshore. he will do an internet banking transfer to my account and arrange for the courier to pick up the item. he provided screenshots of the wire as proof of remittance and the bank statement as proof of deduction. he assured that the funds will hit my account. after the courier picks up the item, he requested for a picture of the airway bill. when I insisted of having a copy of his id and speak to him, he gets irritated and asked why I argue with him act childish. he claimed that if I need to speak to him, he will only be available the following day at 10am as he is out in the field.

on the following day (Saturday) 1st thing in the morning, he provided a screenshot of a USA passport ID. after that asked for the airway bill again, if not he threatened that I am looking for a big problem soon and he has my details. about 10am he finally called and got annoyed on why I need to speak to him. he said that he needs the item to be delivered to his daughter urgently as his daughter going to a camp soon and time is running out. he reassured that there is no problem with the transfer and just a matter of another 1 to 2 days to hit my account. after receiving the item,

over the whole experience, the buyer avoids speaking to me and purposely  scheduled a certain timing when I insists.  he gets agitated when he did not get hold of the airway bill picture and will says I argue and argue with him.

                I was first called up by a chinese speaking man claiming to be from IMDA with a singapore number. He stated that my phone line will be cut off within the next 2 hours because someone created another number with singtel using my particulars. I was told to contact the chinese investigative bureau, a chinese number, and clarify with them so that my line will not be cut. When i called the chinese investigative bureau, they said that a 57 yo man was swindling money by creating fake accounts under my name and phone number in china, and to be sure that i was no relation to the man, they required me to answer questions while the call was recorded. It made the whole situation seem very real because the fake officer was calling other investigative authorities to bring up my case files, etc. i had to declare with my name, and nric. They asked me personal information on my family and living circumstances. The call ended saying they will continue the investigation and contact me through watsapp, plus i was to update them my location at 5pm and 8pm. I was also not to divulge any of information of the case to anyone or they would be implicated into the investigation. the next day, the fake officer called me again saying they had new evidences of my involvement in the case, they even sent me a certificate of the bank accounts created in hong kong, with my chinese name and nric stated. In order to clear my name of any involvement, i was to either fly to hong kong, paying for my own air ticket, and meet with the officers there, or to transfer money to them and freeze my accounts. Thats when i realised that i was a part of a scam because no official would waste 4 hours of talking to you over the phone and subsequently asking you to transfer money or asking for personal bank details. I hung up saying that i would not transfer any money or reveal my bank accounts. Subsequently, i called the singapore police hotline to make a report.

He asked me if i am the owner and if i am at home. he even told me that there is tehcnical problem that their end cannot solve and the owner(myself) needs to solve it. He asked me to use my own laptop to access the router by pressing the ""windows key"" button and follow by ""R"" and kept saying that the owner needs to solve the internet issues on his side, and their technical side is facing problem. I kept asking him about my particulars since Singtel trading representative will know my particulars. He could not give me my details and I immediately know that it is a scam. I put down the phone and quickly called Singtel hotline 1688 to find out that it is a scam. INDEED IT IS A SCAM. because singtel technical representative will never call unless there is request by the user for callbacks.

                I met this man through a dating app and he was very kind and sweet at first. He said he was based in an offshore island in Malaysia and was relocating to Singapore. After a month of texting and phone conversations (he said he was unable to do video calls because his phone could not support it in the offshore island), he called me one day sounding ANXIOUS- the day that he was supposed to come to Singapore. He said that the officers had increase his income tax and he had to pay 9000 ringgit. He asked me if I could help him to transfer USD$2000. He said once he comes to Singapore, he will return the money. Feeling bad and also, hoping to see him, I foolishly sent SGD$1000 (I could not afford more than that). But he did not come that day as he claimed that the process to clear his taxes took long. He said that he will come to Singapore the next day instead. Again, he called and this time said he needed money to pay for the chopper (mode of transportation from the offshore island to KL) and to transport his machines too. This time, i was a bit more wary and said I could not afford it. We still continued chatting and I started asking him for EVIDENCEs/proof. He became very defensive and angry that I did not trust him. I said if he wanted me to lend him money to provide proof but until the hand, he sounded very defensive and rude. He also sent a fake us passport profile once but I was able to see through the scam now after being so stupid. I blocked him from then. I did ask him to return my money but I have yet to receive. I hope this incident will cause one to be wary- to please not blindly trust those online who are sweet and kind. I found his images on another dating site with another name.

                I met this guy who calls himself jin on Instagram. He said he is a Singaporean 
working and living in USA. WithIn 1 week, he professed his love and admiration. We could get along really well and he was very sweet, UNDERSTANDing and encouraging. We exchanged many photos and he knows about my 2 children. He claims to have one child who is 4 years old and is divorced. As I am going through a divorce myself, it was a match. We chatted every day for close to 2 months. He said he is coming back to Singapore to see me and we will plan a life together.

He said his boss needs him to go to belgium for work before he can come back to SG.he is suppose to buy some machinery. On the 6th day of being in belgium, he was going to buy the machine but left his company card at home in USA. Then he realised he cannot use his personal card. Neither can he wire money over to the seller via internet banking . He couldn't ask others or his boss because he didnt want to look incompetent. So he asked for my help - by logging in to his account from Sg and transfer the money to my bank account before transferring it to belgium. Somehow the transfer didnt go through to me. All this while my red flags were up. I did a check on his bank and it seems fake. I also did a photo reverse check on him. I found that he has stolen someone Else's profile and pictures. He is not who he said he was. I blocked him on Instagram and deleted our chat on Google hangout after confronting him. He has since shut down his IG account.

                Met this attractive lady on wechat nearby search and ask me to chat on line instead. offered sex for S$100 for 2 hrs. curious, meet up at simei Eastpoint/MRT as advised by her. she then asked me to take a picture of the nearby macdonald and told me that her boss will contact me after giving her my mobile number. Shortly, a man called without any caller ID. spoke in mandarin and ask me for security reason and 1st time client, to purchase something at AXS machine. then i REALISED he wants me to purchase alipay credit at Rmb500. He also wants me to enter their email address for the purchase which made me suspicious. this is because the password will be sent to the email address to claim the credit purchase.


I noticed something was amiss when they want to make me pay/credit in advance. I also noticed there is a big police signboard near the axs machine warning public about the recent scam. for me, i am lucky that no money is lost in this process...i have uploaded a copy of the axs receipt which the lady has sent me. she insisted that she just need the receipt once payment is made at the axs. i believe this person is cheated when payment is made to the scammer.

                Answered a call, claimed to be dhl, an automated voice in monotonous english saying i have unclaimed package.It then proceeds to mandarin.A Similar call was Received earlier this year , stating the same BS. My call was forwarded to their “customer service officers” who speaks in a pinoy accent. She then mentioned that my package cOntained illegal goods and i have to pay $50 000. She also questioned me what Was the item i sent. It all doesn't tally because:
 
1. I thought I was receiving items? 
2.She said i had illegal items,

3. She should know what the items are then since she is in the courier dept .


She then trIed to speak to me like some federal agent, but i was confused for a moment since she was a customer service officer who seemed to be interrogating me at that moment. 
 
I did give her my particulars until she placed me on hold for the longest time that i realised i was being scammed.


Anyone who encountered the same situation, pls ignore the call, block the number (if any) and share it with your friends and family members to alert them. 

Don't give in to their threats as it's part of their script to scare you into giving them money or personal information.

4. They are very friendly with you, which Real sex worker wont


5. Their will ask You to go to a certain hdb block without unit number


6. And confirm plus chop, there will be 7 eleven at the block or Next to it


7. They will kept asking for your contact number


8. They will either ask you buy Apple credit, or do a traNsfer with axs to their account.


9. Once you transfer first Time, she will ask for more, for whatever reason you might believe. Else someone else will call you and threaThen you to kill you, haunt u down etc


10. Never believe as long they mention about no money transaction.


11. Never believe them when they are already Messaging you on messenger app, and still need your phone number.

                This wasn't the first time I received such calls!

A guy called me up first from 'Starhub' and then a week or so later from 'Singtel'. He claims that my BROADBAND has unusual activity and someone else has HIJACKED my home INTERNET. He then asks me to go to my computer and start logging into a website. 

A which point I tell him this is a scam and hang up. 

I am reporting this as I dont want others to be scammed as once they take control of your COMPUTER anything can happen. 

It sounded like he was from an indian call center as both times the person had a thick indian accent and I could hear lots of other people in the background making calls.

Alert! I received an incoming call from this number (9684777) which happened to be an automated voice message when i picked up, saying i have a parcel from singpost and press ""2"" to speak to the customer service officer (didnt mentioned the purpose of the call). So i pressed ""2"" and this man asked my nric number and my full name (he asked me to spell it out). I immediately felt suspicious of course and questioned him, he said he needed the information to book the item send to me. ( i was sure as i havent ordered anything), then he mentioned that the sender's details of the parcel is on my name so i have to talk to Guangzhou Interpol officer, he gave me the parcel number and other details and transfer my call to Interpol officer, he was trying to threaten me and telling me that i have to go to Guangzhou to launch a complaint else you will be in trouble. I said i am in Singapore then he asked me to go to a website (gaj.qz.gov.cn) and check the number, till time i googled about them and find that its a scam and cut the call. Please be aware and don't share any details to them even though it's a Singapore number and automated voice message.

Upon answering, i was attended to an automated voice note saying that i have a parcel that hasn't been mailed and enter '3' if i wish to know what parcel it was. reason because i decided to enter '3' - i actually thought it was the parcel i ordered online. however, when i pressed '3', i was directed to a guy whom i assumed to supposedly be representing the parcel company. it was just weird because his voice was sort of echoing and the first thing he asked was who's on the line. and i said my name. weirdly enough, he responded by asking 'are you malay?'. i said yes. he then questioned if i could speak mandarin and i said no. he hung up on me.

Says also he is american but has chinese ethnicity, never met his dad and only has his mom. At first everything normal. Until he said he went to cambodia coz the building they made collapsed. He didnt asked for money. But he gave me his logins to his bank account called chesterfield mutual bank to transfer money to the building owner. I got suspicious and found out the the bank is fake. Also he does not want to video call. He has a british accent. I think he is using other persons identity but i cannot find his photos in reverse image searches. He really seemed so real and nice and very consistent in his stories. Also believable that he lives too here in sg, only that he travels alot. He is not pushy about love or anything but very caring and concern about you. Beware coz i think this persons behind the picture is very manipulative. I dont think the scammer is the same as the picture though.

CHATTED for abit and she offer me sex service 100 for 2 hrs. i take up her OFFER and meet her at limbang shopping mcd. When i reached, i went toilet to pee and msg her that i have reached. She said her agent need to call me to verify me FIRST. I sat on the toilet bowl and waited. A chinese speaking guy with unknown NUMBER CALLED and the moment i heard axs machine i hung up. Then he text me with threatening msg saying he is ang soon tong . I laughed so hard almost fell off the toilet seat. I knew abt all these sex scams, alipay, itunes long ago so i did not lose anything that day.

An advice to all men - it is very simple to detect them. I'm not sure abt other platforms but for WECHAT, the moment they accepted u, they will send u a template giving u their LINE id and WHATSAPP, saying she doesn't use wechat to chat. The hp number will never be local one, it will start with +60 or +852 etc. A simple google will tell u which country code is THAT. 

They are very pro in convincing u to use the AXS for payment. Already tested with few of them. Their pics are pretty, voice are sweet, concern abt u, yeah i KNOW that but don't for IT!

                Received sms from Martin and even went to check his company background. I thought i was being smart by going to the website and checking via the website contact if Martin did work there. The website had a legit REGISTERED business number and i DIDN'T give it much thoughts. I was contacted by mervin via the website Whatsa chat function. He told me that he can assist me instead. He never addressed me martin works for him. The website looked legit so i blindly trusted and submitted aLl my documents thinking i was just getting a quote. Next thing i knEw, i was informed loan APPROVED and i still stupidly thought its from a bank. The next day, i received message from

mervin that $700 has been DEPOSITED into my account. I was shocked and all warning bells started ringing. I insisted he take the money back and he arranged to meet me the next day at 2.30pm to explain. At 1.30pm, he messaged me to TRANSFER $1,000 to a posb savings account. I got scared when he threatened to come to my house and just TRANSFERred to him. Then he send another message for $3,000. That’s when i called him and he threatened Me And told me he is loanshark. That all info were fake. I’m shocked by my own stupidity and now want to share this as no matter how educated or highly paid you are, the scammers have a way to tempt you. 

Mine was low interest rates.

I’ve reported to polIce and just installed CCtV at mu house. To take away the power from my Scammers, im sharing this With my boss and colleagues as well my neighbours. I wish i found this page earlier and now I’ll do my part to spread the word.

Later I came across a poster alerting the public about the iTunes gift cards scam. Then I googled this and knew how the scammers cheat people using iTunes card.

                Received a phone call from SG Mobile no and after picking up the call there was an automated voice message saying that i have an unclaimed package, and requested me to press '3' for more details. 

after pressing '3' i was directed to speak with a PRC phone operator from DHL. He requested for my name or package ID before he can check more about the package. After providing my name, he claimed that in his records, i had sent a package from sg to shanghai on 29 Oct and the package was detained by custom as it contained 21 illegal passports. i replied that i was not even around in sg to do so, and the operator acted in disbelief to say that it's impossible because your mobile no. is in the system etc. 
i ended the phone call after scolding the person to check on their internal system to get things right. 

i haven't lost my cash per se but in retrospect, i've already unknowingly provided my phone, name and year of birth.

We make a CALL AND HE SPEAK REALLY GOOD ENGLISH. Short of THE STORY, i begin to trust him evEN feel IN LOVE. AND I SHARE MY PERSONAL INFORMATION INCLUDING PICTURES AND VIDEO WHICH HE USE LATER TO threaten ME when one  DAY HE ASKED FOR MONEY AND I REALIZE THAT HE IS A SCAMMER. I Didn’t GIVE HIM THE MONEY AND I BLOCKED HIM IN EVERY OF MY SOCIAL MEDIA, i deactivated my social media account AND CHANGE all MY NUMBER. I blocked every access for him to contact me. It frustrated me because he knew so much about me. He told me that he listed all my family member and close friend.. But i Told him to do anything he want that make him happy. SO THAT THIS IS MY LESSON FOR NOT TRUSTING SOMEONE EASILY. I share because i care.. Please never share anything to strangers.. You will regret it for the rest of your life. I don’t lose money at all but i guess i lost more than money to him. I feel I lost my way and heart broken. Even until all this time i can’t forget everything and it hurts every time i remember him.

                Received call from from 9303 1721 this morning 13 November, claiming to be from DHL Changi with automated voice system in both English and Mandarin. It said there is an issue with my shipment and prompted me to speak to a staff. I am expecting a package hence selected option 3 and was connected to a Mandarin speaking staff. I requested to speak to an English speaking staff but was told all were busy. He said my package has been withheld in Beijing and a letter issued stating dangerous content has been found in my package. I replied no way this was possible, feeling suspicious, I said I will call DHL Singapore to verify and caller hung up immediately. I tactlessly gave my DHL tracking number and name away at the start of the call for verification - so they now have a name tagged to my mobile number to carry out more scams in the future (identity theft possibly).

Caller's background noise sounded like a call center with many staff busy on the line, however, it could be pre-recorded.

                I wish to report a scam caller for DHL delivery scam:
Received 2 missed calls yesterday from various local numbers. Today received 2 calls from a number 95890324

1st call AT 12PM, a robot voice says you have an uncollected DHL package. As I had received several packages recently for work, but none for DHL I THOUGHT THE SUPPLIERS HAD SENT A PACKAGE VIA DHL.  I pressed 3 AS PER THE ROBOT VOICE INSTRUCTIONS. After a waiting time whereby the line sounded it was connected overseas, a man answered the phone with ""Wei?"". I responded in Chinese (though I do not speak it) ""Ni ser suei?"" (Who are you) I SAID. He then responded to say things to me in which I did not understand. The moment he heard me say a word of English he hung up.

2nd call at  12:42 was the same NUMBER, except that the moment the man heard me say ""Hello?"" he hung up as he knew I was not Chinese speaking.

I believe this is a scam calling robot linked to human operators in China, but using local Singapore numbers for credibility. I will report any more I encounter. To confirm the number today was +65 95890324.

Me, being a gullible student, was afraid of his threats of going to hurt my family, and i obliged in sending more. when i sent $2000, he said that fee was for protecting the girl, then i had to send another $2000 for the hotel room fee.

                Met the girl on tinder and matched with her. Then she asked for my whatsapp and I gave it to her. Then she said that she was providing massage services and then told me that we can have sex for $100/2hr as well. 

I was interested and tried to meet up with her. She told me to go to an apartment at bugis and I waited for her there, then she told me her agent will call me and the agent told me to use  alipay. 

Since I wasn't Singaporean, I asked if there was an alternative, he said to buy iTunes. Then I bought an iTunes card and stupidly scratched off the back and gave them a picture. The agent then called me and said that he needed $1200 dollars as insurance that I was not with the police. I then said that I didnt have that much money since I was a student and he said to borrow from Friends. My phone then died because my battery went flat. After that, when I got home and I charged my phone, the guy called and threatened to kill my family if I didn't cough out the $1200. I have now blocked him and the girl.

                received a call from 86277161 @ 09:44am 9 nov 2019

at first i thought i missed a parcel delivery and was ask to provide tracking number but there is no tracking number from my side so name was given to him to check.

from there onward, he claimed that i have a parcel TRACKING NUMBER #039258 PARCEL SENT BY ME FROM CHANGI DHL TO GUANGZHOU CHINA RECEIVER NAME FANG JIE. the parcel contained 21 passports and 1 credit card which are now detained by guangzhou customs which require me to do an immediate action with it by transferring the call to china police.

i told him this wasn't sent by me because i wasn't around (am outstation) during the date mentioned , he questioned me further could it be someone else use my id to deliver it which is ridiculous. no tracking number found on dhl website. he keep threatening that i am responsible for it. 

after a long 10 minutes conversation, i decided not to continue with him because i need to work. he hung up the call.

i've recorded the conversation from the half way till the end.

However when he arrived in Singapore, HE said he needed my help to pay $3,500 cause the airport POLICE found out he Brought in foreign currency. I told him I don't know him and so I won't send any money. He said he managed to negotiate down to $1,500. I just blocked him.

She stated  that i need to open a browser on my computer and she will show me. I then asked if she at least can tell me my public ip address. She replied that i need to open a browser as she doesn't have access to a computer right now.

                I would like to share my experience of how i got scammed in facebook. I added this girl name of shaira ong on facebook and she claimed to be a social escort in singapore offering sexual services. I wanted to engage her services for two hours and the fee was 150sgd so she asked me to transfer it to a posb saving account whom she she claimed as her admin's account. We agreed to meet at Jurong east street 13, block 133 at a coffeeshop below the block. After reaching she said she needed another 170 sgd to be transfered to her admin's posb account as she got a penalty from her admin for agreeing to meet me at a earlier timing instead of the timing we fixed earlier on facebook messenger. She had promised to pay me back in cash after we met so i agreed and transfered but right after i transfered she asked me to do a western union transfer to her boss in phillipines whose name is of danica artocilla. She asked me to do a transfer of 250sgd in western union to her boss and she said that fee was to cover her rental in the room she is staying as if she dont pay for room rental, she wont be able to meet me. So i did do a western union transfer to her so called boss in phillipines but after that she kept giving lots of excuses and empty promises of returning me back my money in cash when we meet but i waited for 4 hours but she didnt turn up. That's when i knew i was scammed and made a police report. I transfered a total of 1.3ksgd in total to her in that four hours i waited for her. My advice to everyone is not to fall for this type of scams in facebook where girls claim themselves as escorts offering sexual services. It's all a scam.

                This morning (20 Oct 19) I received a phone call at 1104hrs from a lady (China accent) who identified herself as a staff from Changi DHL through this phone number: +6593400611.

She told me that at China customs, they found and retained a package containing 21 passports & 11 credit cards which bears my phone number: 98385962. 
She mentioned that this package (package ID: 168956) was sent out from Changi DHL to China, Shang Hai (Sheng Jiang, Yan Yang Lu No.161), to a person named 'Chen Wen Jun' on 02 Oct 19 at 1027hrs.

She asked me if this package was sent out by me which i told her that i did not send out any package to China. Thereafter, she said, ""Your personal particulars might have been compromised. My superior say that the only way to help you now, is to quickly make a police report to keep the police aware that your identity had been misappropriated. Let me divert you to Police HQ to initiate the police report and record your statements. Pls pressed '999' to talk to the Police Officer to record your statement."" 

At this moment, i felt very fishy about this situation.

Next moment, after pressing '999', a guy (China accent) took over the phone which somewhat increase my suspicion that this is a scam call. I was thinking since when did Singapore Police hired China international as their staff. The guy started by asking what he can help. i told him that i would like to make a police report, pertaining to a case of misuse of my identify for illegal purpose. He asked me what my official name was, and start to ask if i had misplaced or dropped my pink IC, Driving license & passport before and i replied him 'No'. Then he further probed, ""How can that be ?! You never booked your air tickets using passport before ?!"" and i said 'yes.. but it is all done online'. 
Then he started to sound agitated a bit and start to ask for some other details which i don't quite get what he wants. So i told him to get a English speaking Police Officer to talk to me instead. Without replying, the guy hung up the phone. The call ended at around 1139hrs.

then i recalled, he said before he doesn't has malaysia bank account cos he doesn't need any. but when he asking for money he said i can bank into his maybank or public bank.

At first they dont even mention that it was weekly payments. In the middle of the night i told them to cancel the request as i am not interested but they said had been transferred and all. They asked for a picture of my house door and all. On the first payment i made was 200 they give me an acct number. Second was on the 8th oct i thought was the same acct number but they say thats their customer and that does not count. I felt sceptical since that they must wait for next acct. 3rd payment was 12th oct 200. Basically ive paid 800 but then on the 12th then explained all that is defer PAyment..  they inform me to clear have to make 600 one shot payment so i told them on the 18th i will clear. They give me their own acct number which is dbs account number. And now im a stress up cause they say not counted too as it supposed to be 200 on that acct then 400 wait for their next acct number. What should i do. I'm ignoring them since yesterday and just afraid they hunt my parents and hurt my little son. Please help me. And since on the 2nd or 3rd repayment ive been telling this nick im at station working. Its a lied to stop them from coming but i dont think they believe me.

He said he grew up in usa (funny he didn't have an American accent but an irish one instead) and had moved back to perth to restart his life and set up his business in seafood broking after ex wife died of car crash. 

After a couple of weeks of chatting online, he professed how he was into me without having met me in person yet and the next thing I knew, he was going to come to Singapore to meet up and also clear his shipment at jurong island at the same time. then came one afternoon when he asked to borrow 3k due to stock clearance issue at customs and had a shortfall of cash. I then declined to help politely and suggested he could arrange to get an overdraft from the bank after which, he started to get passive aggressive about me not willing to help. 

I then tried him again and offered that I would help to pay on condition that I would meet him in person to pay directly to whoever he owed but he insisted that I transferred money to a personal bank account of ""hua siew moy"" in which I declined and persisted with my conditional offer. he then started getting angry and told me to keep my money which I did.

I pressed ""2"" and was connected to a person who took my name & Singapore FIN (as I didn't have a parcel slip number to refer to). They then explained that there was a problem with a parcel I had sent which had illegal contents, from guangzhou international airport. They put me thru to an official who, by way of authentication, called me from a caller-ID which matches the phone number at http://gaj.gz.gov.cn. Seemed legit, although i realise I should have called that number rather than let them call me, as caller-ID may not be trustworthy... They proceeded to get me to send pics of both sides of my singapore IC, a selfie and my singapore drivers license. eventually a friend and work colleague looked at what i was doing and passed me the link to this site where i searched and quickly found these similar stories. I then hung-up the call. But so much information given away already :-(

The line was very noisy and kept breaking off and i had to get her to repeat herself multiple times. She claimed that there was suspicious activity from my router these couple of weeks. Problem is that my broadband line is under my parent's name and they shouldn't be calling me if there is a problem in the first place. Hung up on them and called SingTel to verify and to no surprise, nobody at SingTel contacted me and there was no problem with my internet at all.

                He offered me a loan and i said how much would the interest be? he said 30K 570x60 monthly u ok? i said what is the qualifications? He said how much your salary? Sent me your IC so that I could check if you are qualified. suddenly your loan is approved. i said i dont need the money yet, he said like that can not ! you just transfer me 500 and after confirmation return me 800 then after 2 hours i will send you the full amount 30K. why do i need to pay you extra 300? that is the policy for first timer. i said i didn't want, what if you send me the amount you want and send you back the same amount. he said no can not. then I decline offer to take the loan from him.

They said they were from starhub and singtel and said they received a lot of warning message from my router. They asked me to look at my router to see how many lights were blinking. 

Knowing this is likely a scam, i tested them further.  i asked  if they need to talk to my son who were more tech-savvy, they said no need. so i was right.

- she replied my email quickly and always rushing me to get back to her and that she will pay in advance the money to secure the room.
- i got suspicious when she transferred more money than i asked for and insisted that i help her transfer the extra money she sent to her mover and she gave me mover address which is in uae.
- my suspicion was arose because she was quite rude on the email by insisting that i must help her pay the mover else she can't get her stuff over to singapore.
- i was almost prepared to help her pay but i figured i will wait until i receive all the funds before i do that. 
- because she was rude, i told her off on the email and even said i won't transfer as she didn't ask for my permission on the help.
- but she replied and still insisted i help her do the transfer and that's where i got more suspicious and decided to ignore her.
i waited more than 1 week and checked paypal a few times but still received no funds. 

please beware of the language used as i realised their english is not proper considering she's a singaporean.

It started off with knowing this person from social media. I added him on wechat. There, this person offered sex services at a rate of $100/90min.

I was curious and agreed to the offer. When i reached the place, she asked for my mobile number and told me that there shouldn't be any cash transaction and instructed me to pay for the service at axs machine. 

After that, she told me that her boss needed to advise me on some security issues. 

He required me to buy Alipay credit through the axs machine, which i dumbly followed despite seeing all the warning. Just when i thought it's done, he demanded more deposits for security purposes. He kept pressing me to put down the deposits to the point when i told him i have no money and would not want to continue and requested for the deposited money to be returned, he said this os not possible, and even threatened that even if i were to forfeit the initial amount they will send someone to deliver it to my home and will demand to pay for the delivery fees that can amount to $6000.

When i said that i had no money then says he can reduce the amount. And lucky for me, the limit of nets purchases and Alipay top up had prevented me from completing all the transactions that amount to $6,600.

Throughout he also asked me not to put down the phone (and the number either origins from Indonesia (+62000000001) or is hidden) this repeats for verification purposes, for refund purposes. Why i sucked up to their promises that the money will be refunded based on their rule... 

Throughout the event they spoke in Taiwanese mandarin and i corresponded only to the person that i added on Wechat. The rest of the phone calls were incoming from this 'boss'.

After being asked for more money and threatened that they belong to a black society in taiwan and the boss is that of marina bay sands, i felt something is really not right and reported to the police. 

Lesson learnt, be careful, when befriending unknown people on social media.

In there, he told me he is an orphan of chinese origin, adopted by a rich family in uk, grew up & educated in uk, recently spent usd $5Mil to divorce his wife. However, his tone and way of expressing a bit childish, Doesn't sound like someone who's in his late 40S, gone thru so much and doing a successful biz. He said he was in sg Because plan to start a CONSTruction company in sg. But when i asked DId he made friends wih anyone when in sg, he said i am the only one, the other one a hotel manager in sg. When i became suspicous abt his identity, i looked thru his ig profile and notice his photos were few and recently uploaded. Most of His 'followers' LOOKs like FROM SEA, with very few caucasian looking ONES. Something unusual for someone who has grown up and worked in uk all these while. He did NOT ask to meet me or speak with me over phone, but got so CHILDISHLy offended when i asked him for a selfie photo. I suspect this is a scammer who has stolen SOMEONE'S ig account to con PEOPLE. I hv SINCE BLOcked him and unfollowed him. But notice recently his follower group has grown bigger. He might change his name to continue cheating others, so pLEase check out this profile picture and beware.

I was contacted via some foreign number which i hang up multiple occasions. But in Jan this year, I picked up the call and caller sold me proposal to trade online. I was asked to deposit USD$100 at the beginning and started trading. When I ""made some profits"", i put down more money and I saw a profit of ""$50K"" in my trading account. As time passed, the contact with the broker got less frequent. Then come to the point suddenly the broker disappear and became uncontactable. I couldn't reach anyone via phone, email or even skype. So i was running solo for the following few months. 
I decided that i can do trades on my own. Yes, i have traded on my own and over the next 3-4 month and made a profit of almost 300% of my invested capital. The problem comes when i have make request for withdrawal of my profits over the few months, i couldn't get a single cent back. The request always get rejected by the system. Can you imaging that i made over 40 requests and not a single times get approved? Yes, this is where i know i am being scammed of my hard earned savings. I am convinced that i couldn't get back any amount back as this is totally a scam organisation i am dealing with. 

My lesson here is not to trade online! and put down all my savings. I hope my story can help to caution people not to believe such quick-to-get-rich scheme. Think before you act. My money lost is a lesson learnt.

Encountered from paktor app, profile was facebook verified. He requested we chat on line app and gave me his userid to add him. Thru photos and conversations, seems like a dream man, good looks, well to do, can cook, go gym and exercise, caring, sweet talk etc. (too good to be true so beware!)

So thru chats, i understood he was a christian, went to city church mission. He was a singaporean, parents and sister passed away in car accident when he was 5 and was brought to moscow by his uncle. His uncle had tumor cancer and is in critical condition at raffles hospital now, he even sent me a photo of a patient lying in a hospital bed. 

We chatted on phone once, and i started to doubt his nationality so did some questioning, and he said mom and uncle was thai, dad was singaporean. I wasnt convinced since it was not consistent to what i understood before. 

He is working as a designer per time while hoping for an interview call for a maritime job. Twice, we arranged to meet but it never happen because of his work. One day, the call came and he had to go out to south china sea to work in the rig for 7 weeks. At week 2, he asked me to email his company to request for a 3 days leave for him so he can come to sg to meet me. Although weird for me to apply his leave for him i agreed to do so, the email address he provided was a gmail which aroused suspicion, since he mentioned his company was conocophillips i was expecting a company domain. I emailed anyway and recieved a reply saying for him to leave the rig there was a transport fee. I showed him the email and he asked me to pay this fee first and that he will return to me once he landed. His reason was because he has no money while in the rig. I refused since it made no sense. He was agitated when i asked if he was a scammer. I ignored his texts and thought it was the end but he was persistent, continued to shower me with care, and later said he managed to borrow part of the amount from a friend and asked me to lend the balance, so i blocked him on the app!

My mum was irritated as the routine was very different from what singtel usually does (they ask to talk directly to the account holder), and told the guy off, but he was still persistent, however he had an audibly irritated tone. He answered rudely, saying that this is why singtel hired me for the IT department. he then asked to press windows r, which we did at first, but then when he asked to key something in, we immediately cancelled it and told him to call the account holder himself if he was still persistent.

                i am a 50 Year Old singaporean running a local music retail company with a partner.
i ran into some credit card debts and due to some late payments and poor payment record could never secure any term loan to clear the debts with any local banks
received a watsapp message from this person eric wong claiming to be from bst credit pte ltd 
did a google search and found that bst credit was a legal licensed money lender so i trusted him
his first message was this: 
Hi.i am Eric Wong from BST Credit Pte Ltd Offers You Promotion Loan In Town . 5kClear 450x12Month 15kClear 825x20Month(Whatsapp 86703871/
98106009)UN/UNSUB

i took up his offer on the 15k loan by replying to his message this was on 21st sep 2019
he replied to say that the offer has expired and i have to make some transactions with his company to show that i am a old account holder to be entitled for the offer and i naively took his words for it.

he then transferred S$460.00 into my dbs bank account to show that he is genuinely helping me to secure the loan. he said i can return the S$460.00 with interest by transferring 2 payments of S$250.00 back into the uob savings account
i was flying off to japan on 25th sep so i hurriedly made the ibanking first transfer bank to him

5 days later he replied again ( always with a recorded vocal message ) to say he is processing the loan and that i can transfer the 2nd part of S$250.00 back to him. 

2 days later he again messaged to say the S$460.00 loan clearance was 3 x S$250.00 and not 2 x S$250.00. i started getting suspicious when he also said that my loan is getting some trouble getting approved cos the boss found out i was asking from many other credit companies ( which is not true ) . 

yesterday 8/10 at 1PM he asked for the 3rd payment of S$250.00 before 3PM and i already was not comfortable but still transferred him that 3rd payment of S$250.00. after that i said i will go and meet him at his office in jurong and asked for his business registration number. this is when he stops responding

i must have been too desperate to clear my debt to be so gullible. 
I am not seeking to get back the S$250+ that i lost out but just want to have the authorities help prevent him from scamming another victim.

When time to ""pay"" the $800, keep saying account closed so need to postpone at $200 each time. Postponed many times. Finally, realise it was all a scam. Tell them to cancel and refund, he refused and said must paid 10% of loan amount to cancel. Called my office. My Details given to him. Lodged report after gt credit said not from them.

This is the third time i received the call. The first number was +96911810, then was +93111244757, and today was 83342841. All three calls were received in the last 7 days. 
First it was a guy who called and claimed to be from SingTel Internet Department, and wanted to check if I was the owner of the Internet connection. When I asked what was my SingTel account number, he hung up. 
Then, came another call, again from the same department. She told me the same issue and I asked her what was my account number. This time, the caller told me that she didn’t have the info and when 
Then came another call to ask me to key in some commands into my command prompt. After giving me a list of instructions, he tried to convince me to install 'ultraviewer', which is a free remote access software. Using that he wanted to get into my computer. I told him i downloaded it (which, of course i didn't) and he asked for the username and password. I shared a fake username and password. He was unable to get access to my computer with it (how would he?). 

He then asked if the number was correct and i told him, of course not, i am not dumb to let some stranger in my system and that this scam has been going on for a long time and no one will fall for it anymore. He finally hung up!

Point to note, there was a lot of background noise. I could hear other people talking as though it was a call centre. Be aware, and do not share your information or allow access to anyone through your computer

He said that the Indian consulate has requested a deportation order. Reason cannot be disclosed. He spoke so confident and arrogant, that you will feel shaken up emotionally. But then, i recollected myself and asked for his employee id. He gave an employee id immediately without hesitation and asked me the reason for asking employee id.

                It was about 8pm when i arrive to the scene as the scammer suggested i was so excited to meet the girl as the girl was really pretty. She ask me to take a photo of where i am at and then proceed to ask me for my phone number, so i give her my phone number in exchange to contact her but somehow i end up talking to a dude which also logical since maybe i think he was an agent or some sort.So she then told me to buy mol worth of 71.67$ so i done it.fyi the application that i spoke with her is MIchat


after a short while the agent call me asking me to pay additional 477.83$ for deposit and will give it back and the reason for the deposit is to avoid any aggressive act  towards the girl. so i told him i cant pay that much as i'm still a student so i pay half of it instead of 477.83 i payed 238.91$ but not long he ask to pay additional 238.91$ since all customer did that and its unfair. so i proceed to give him that sum of money.


moving on he began told me to pay another 716.74$ to insure of our safety when we get to the place. but i refuse because i did not have that sum of money so he suggested to ask for my ic photo front and back so being the dumb ass i am i gave him and from that he still wants the money regardless and began using the info i had given to make death threat towards me and my family and even give me look at video that they gonna do to me. So i panic and seek guidance but in the end i decided to leave even though the scammer keep asking me to stay and will call me at 10pm which he did but it was 11 pm but i did not pickup is because i was on the phone to ask for help.In the i just ran and told him the money that i gave u could have it.

This guy followed me on Instagram. 
He told me that his parents are Singaporean but he is born and raised in London. He said he is a pilot of Thai airways. After a few exchange of msgs in Instagram he asked for my whatsapp number. After giving my number, the next day, I realised that I couldn’t find his Instagram page anymore. 
After a week, he then told me that he sent me a parcel with gifts from him since i’ve been a REAL friend and he got selected to fly the plane with the UN Secretary after a successful interview. He insisted on sending a package containing luxury items such as Chanel handbag, jewellery, valued at GBP$15,000. He sent me a receipt of his transaction and track code. 
Today, he asked me if I’ve received the package as his was an express courier. When I asked him to check with the courier directly, he was full of angst and told me that he wasn’t in Singapore. When I went to the website to check and was told that I needed to pay S$1750 as my parcel was overweight. This is obviously a scam, so beware ladies when chatting with online friends!

macus no is 81043923 and he claimed that his office number at asia square tower 2 level 7, no is 85902150, common sense this is a hp number no direct line.. macus is a malaysian mandarin spoken guy. and he mentioned that he is at tampines during 7.30pm and need to off work pending for my $800 to clear the system before the actual loan and move on. he did mentioned that $400 will be refunded too. i am sick and tired of such tricks and talks. i had explained to him on every process and steps i know he could not answer so ended raise up voice and scold. just be careful on such scam and please check out with their competitors or approval license money lender to check out all procedures & T&C before falling into such traps.

                Got a call today (1/10/2019 at 10:30 am) where the lady said she is calling from Singtel and that they have noticed many foreign ids accessing my computer and she will help me flush them out. I asked her how i can verify that she's calling from Singtel. She asked me to login to my computer, access my cmd prompt and type ""assos"". Then she read back a no displayed as clsid. then she asked me to close the cmd prompt and type another command. Luckily for me my phone had very little charge and got disconnected. She called me back as soon as my phone was put in the charger. I felt a little uneasy by then and told her that i cant speak to her then. She asked me when i'll be free and said she'll call back then. I told her to leave her no with me and said i'll call her instead. Immediately she cut the call.

She had a distinct PHILIPPINE accent. later i browsed to see if it was a scam and found that it was. 

Don't follow stranger's instructions blindly!

                1) Received a call from this girl (that might have an indian accent) that said she was from singtel telecommunications techinical service department and told me that my internet has been compromised. 

2) it happened in the middle of the day at 2:03pm. through a phone call.

3) she said she was calling from singtel but i am not a singtel user. then she said that they are the mother of all tlecommunications in singapore and they found a breach in our internet and that it has been compromised by outside users. then she asked for the number of bars on my router. 
so i told her i was not at home, then she wanted to call me back in the evening. so i told her that i do not stay at home, then she hung up the call immediately. 

she is clearly suspicious because she did not have my name, and did not address me properly, and spoke as if she reheared the line about the compromising of internet multiple times. then when i asked her for her name and what her department was again, she replied with a ""huh?"" in a completely different tone, showing a slight change in character. 

i think she knew that i was getting suspicious and hence she hung up the phone before anything, however, had i continued, they might have asked for router numbers and may attempt to hack into your system. do beware.

-Baby since I’m in the war zone it’s difficult at this moment and without my exit form I won’t be allowed to leave. I would not be able to contact the military board from here due to restrictions as you may know by now.
-Baby, I will need your assistance. I will like you to do me a favor to request for my exit form on my behalf from the military board.
-I will write the letter for you to contact the military board on my behalf requesting for my exit form. It’s will be given to you. Here at the war zone we can’t receive or send stuffs.
-Once you receive it, I will teach you how to scan and send me a copy through email baby.

                It started off with the girl approaching me on Tinder. After a short interesting chat, I added her on Whatsapp as she requested. There, she suddenly offered sex at a rate of $100/90min.

I agreed to the offer. When I reached her place, she told me her boss need to advise me on some security issues. He required me to buy Alipay credit through the AXS machine, which I dumbly followed despite seeing all the warning. Just when I thought it's done, he demanded deposits for security purposes. He kept pressing me to put down the deposits even when i told him i have no money, asking me to borrow from friends first. He also asked me not to put down the phone. This repeats for Verification purposes, for refund purposes. Why i sucked it up is their promises that the money will be refunded based on their rule. after being asked for more money for bank acc protection purposes, i got fed up and went to the police to report the case.

learnt my lesson with 3k gone and the fear that my family will be targeted by the syndicate.

I connected with him on a dating app called paktor. Within talking for a day, he ask to exchange numbers and to chat on whatsapp.
He say he's from america and his parents are from sg but had passed away when he was 4. He grew up in the states with his uncle. Claimed that his parents own a house in clementi.
Within less than a week of chatting he confesses to me saying how he likes me and wants to relocate to sg. Called me once via whatsapp call, his accent sounded legit american accent (i did read about the scams beforehand) his english is still quite good. (maybe the scammers now got an upgrade of their skills)
Anyway after all this, he started his story saying that he will be flying to kuwait to work at an oil rig for 3 weeks contract. (scam alert!)
And that is where i started believing that he is a scam and i tried to say to him that there's alot of scammers nowadays posing as oil rig workers. And i ask him if he's for real. He got all sad about it and saying that he's not.
Even after what i trying to expose him as a scammer, he still try to talk to me. Until one day he suddenly disappeared for 2 days and came back with an excuse that he was busy and that his equipment is spoiled. And he start to show his true colors by saying that he has to pay for the spoiled equipment. I googled alot of these most oil rig companies are supposed to pay for spoilt equipment if under contract or insurance. 
I told him all this and he still insisted that he have to pay on his own since its his equipment. I try to avoid the question of money but he still comes up with a reason that i have already read before in the scam stories. Saying that he can't open his offshore account and that he need to transfer money into that account. I knew he is going to ask me about it but i purposely avoided that question and say i'm sorry to hear that and take care. He seems unhappy about it and i deleted him. 
Just be careful ladies scammers have upgraded their skills and languages. Never ever send any money to people you have not met. Be careful on who you talk to on dating apps too, a lot of fake profiles. Handsome and sweet words doesn't means they are nice. Don't be desperate for love and get cheated by them. Be smart!

After picking up the call wondering what emergencies there were, the caller (who sounded like an Indian national) told me he was from Singtel and was calling me about internet services that I used as they picked up an error message sent from my router. Over the phone I could hear one other person in the background seemingly talking on the phone as well. Naturally as I don't subscribe to any internet services using that number, I tried to clarify. This time the caller asked me if I was ""so-and-so"" (a pseudo name I use with my private number). After probing a bit, the caller sensed something was wrong and immediately hung up the phone.

He called me a couple of times, but i didn't respond. when i got calls, the screen showed ""business department"" (no number), and when turning on video, it showed starhub logo only. luckily, i have my computer nearby, thus i didn't show my Id.

He told me my home internet has been source of suspicious attacks on singtel's servers and he wanted to investigate it. I told him that i don't have singtel connection and he replied that singtel owns all internet connections in singapore. I was already aware of this kind of scam as my wife also received similar call last month and she disconnected the call. 

This time the scammer asked my how many lights are blinking in the router. I told him none of them blink as the router is switched off all the time (lol). He then asked me to look at the back of the router and provide the details printed there. I told him to contact my service provider and they can give him all details about my connection. He threatened me that he will disconnect my connection immediately. When I didn't, he hung up.

                REceived a call from 'singtel' saying they need to check the modem - how many lights are blinking. they are checking on security, the staff name and staff id was provided to me too. I told them not under singtel. have switched to starhub but they say they not bothered by the connection provider, starhub still part of singtel????

as I am not at home, given them home line to call my husband. my husband answered and requested to enter some  command prompt  on the laptop. he did not give and told them if required, ask the police to call us again before we do it. the call was then disconnected.

checked with both singtel and starhub, there is no such call from their dept. they would not call anyone unless is customer reporting issue to them directly. they have said it probably a scam and we can either report to police or make a call to anti scam.

                I actually just in finance problem and just nice the loan text me in the WhatsApp, so I try to text back and ask for any inquiries for the loan of 20k 60mths. And they ask for my particular and bank account, NRIC, work place, income per month and 2 next of kin contact number.  After given them the details, they said my loan was approved and will transfer 1k to my account then transfer back to them 1.5k to secure the loan. After transfer they tell me to wait will proceed the loan. Later on they said have to pay insurance fee 1k. I said I dont have 1k to pay and they discount to $750 and I still said dont have enough money. Then they lower down to $500. So I think $500 is ok. Beause they told me that after pay this $500, in 30mins times can meet up to take the cash. After 30mins they said before 8pm will meet me up. But in 7plus they call me again said that that had a meeting said I still have to pay a lawyer fee 5% and a stamp fee 5% total 2k. I get angry and f them up and told them totally no money to pay the fees and don't ask for money again, if u want show me the cash first. Then they die die said discount to 1k then can meet up pass me the cash. I f them up again and said you want come down face to face talk. I said if they think I'm so foolish to trust them. And I also said the 1k I lost never mind let you drink coffee forget it. Then then today 21/9 they still trying to call me and said support them a small loan. It's that funny? And now I decided to report police.

                1) HOW IT HAPPENED 
I got a call on this afternoon (19 sept 2019) at 12:42pm. The call came from local number 98123501, but the call was through viber application, which means the call could have come from some other country also. The person on the other end spoke in a very commanding tone with a forced accent. he said he is from 'central bank of singapore' and they found some irregularities with my bank account. And the accounts will be suspended if I dont act immediately. tHEN i ASKED HIM TO GIVE HIS ORGANISATION NAME. HE TRIED TO BRUSH OFF QUESTION BY SAYING MY BANK ACCOUNTS ARE AT RISK. tHEN i ASKED HIM ONCE AGAIN ABOUT THE EXACT NAME OF HIS ORGANISATION, and he disconnected the phone call.

2) WHEN IT HAPPENED 
19 SEPT 2019 AT 12:42PM - call lasted for less than a minute

3) HOW MUCH WAS LOST.
nothing was lost.I just was to share the story so that someone else can be prepared for responding to these scammers.

                I saw a post on spf Facebook and i can relate with the scam warning. I am a filipino and This is about my husband who works in singapore. Someone made a facebook account same as his (name & pictures) and then he sent messages to almost all my husband's friends on facebook, including me, asking for our mobile numbers, So i think he knows my husband because he was able to see all my husband's friends on facebook. I have screenshot of the message sent to me and my friend.

It gave us an idea that it is a scam because message was on our request on messenger. Because if it was the real account of my husband, it wont be there.
I just immediately reported it to Facebook and posted it on my Facebook to warn other people because they thought, it was my husband. I am a filipino but i know that the scammer / fake account is in singapore base on the message construction (usually people in sg use ""can"" as part of singlish). Good thing, facebook deactivate that fake account and my husband's real Facebook account remained. With this, we immediately changed our passwords on Facebook and my husband's bank account's in singapore.

                was sourcing out for personal loan online when bumped into www.cmcreditsg.com. website looks legit, with office address , phone number and moneylending license provided. enquired via whatsapp and a representative by the name of kenneth called and was asked to fill up necessary forms to provide personal details inclusive of my nric and cpf statement. within half and hour he called back to inform the loan was approved but was told to do a trial payment first before releasing the $5k loan. (1st flag)

the next day after the application, an amount of $550 was being transferred in my account. then instruction given was to make a first payment of $250 then followed by $800 on specific dates. on the day before the first payment, was surprised when kenneth called and requested for $100 as admin fee. (2nd Flag) both admin fee and first payment was transferred via online banking to A same account number. when it comes to second payment, instead of clearing the $800, kenneth requested to transfer $250 to a different account number. (3rd Flag).

after making the 3 online transfers, the next following week, realised my account was frozed by the authorities for investigations. Authorities told me to block the number and not contact them. but eventually they started to harass me with different numbers and threatening to hurt my family and neighbours.

so peeps, doesn't mean if website is available, everything is legal. Not worth to go through all the trouble.

Sound very real and anxious, saying that singtel server reported virus has infiltrated into my home broadband
Clam that they need to check some ip address connection that let in virus.
Try to phish my home network IP network connection info using ""netstat scams"" method.
I tried to accommodate them for a short while, until they ask me read some of the output script from the ""netstat command"",
I simply hung up the call without revealing anything
""Robert"" immediately called me back but now using a hp number ""95227981"", 
And now he insisted that I run  ""cmd"" command on my PC , but now using a different ""assoc"" method. And asking to read out some script results from the command. I did not reveal any info but tried delaying him, and after several attempt to delay, he sense not right, and immediately hung up my line, and never call back again.
I am sure this is a ""netstat scam"" and/or ""assoc scam"" case, trying to phish for some ip address/open port to access to my home network, and retrieve sensitive data from my home broadband network.
Beware that there is this ongoing scam. Don’t give information or follow instructions given by a stranger without checks.

                Was urgent on cash so replied to a quick loan msg wanting to loan 10k. At first they transferred 600, and said to deposit back 800. The extra 200 is for a record of transaction before a loan can be dispersed as I had not loan from their company before. Then few days later they just text and expect u to cash deposit within 15mins. I just did internet transfer and that guy called back screaming and said it must be cash deposit. Asked me to do another deposit asap which I had to borrow from friend urgently and deposited again. Then later sent them the receipt and they called again said they received and will disperse the loan now but must deposit a late payment fee of 800. They will then proceed to REFUND the 800 and 10k loan to me. Sensing something not right, I decided to call the police and was advised to stopped depositing money to their said Accounts as it is a loan scam. Have already made a police report and till now they keeping calling me wanting me to transfer money and.even suggest that I do a favour they transfer 400 to me while they hold the late charge and transfer back 800 in 5 days.

Am worried for myself and my family as I had given my NRIC to them. Also worried they keep call my office and family to harass them.

It was then she claimed that she's currently working in Germany and would like to move back to Singapore. She then further claimed that she does not have a phone nor she has any online banking access. Furthermore, she works late and by then the bank will have closed. Hence, she asked me if I have a PayPal and whether can she placed a deposit via paypal. Suspecting it was a scam, I ask her why need to place through paypal? She then forwarded her supposedly 'NRIC' to me. 

So I went to google her name separately and realised there was a similar scam of the same name happened previously. The scammer would sell the same story and then once you replied yes to the paypal account, the scammer will send you a fake screenshot showing that he or she has deposited money but will need you to send the money in order to activate the dormant account and unblock the fund transfer. However, in actual fact, the scammer didn't transfer any funds at all. 

2) it happened 3 days after I first posted my ad on the website.

                2 Men with indian accent claimed they were from 'singtel' and said my internet has problems due to malware files on 11 sept 19, around 11am. 
that was the first warning sign for me as i do not use anything singtel. i proceeded to go on with the call, where i spoke to 2 men. the first guided spoke to me about the internet having malware and harmful files that is affecting the internet. he told me to switch on my laptop and said i can ""take your own sweet time"". once i switched on, he instructed me to open the windows command page, which is a black screen, usually used for technical issues. then he said he will have to call his supervisor/manager to guide me through the next few steps. the second man came on the line and asked me if i had my windows command screen up. once confirmed, he told me to type 'assoc' and hit the enter button. i did not proceed because at this time i knew it was a scam, so i asked him if he got the right number because we do not use singtel. right after this he put down the phone.

                I posted an Ad in gumtree for renting one of my common room. I received a Interest request from 'LI XIAOJIE' as 

'I'm interested. Please contact me.
Hi, is the room still available? I'm interested. Kindly email me @ [email protected]'

I replied yes and provided my mobile number. then, I enquired my COLLEAGUES about the name 'LI XIAOJIE' relates to Girl or Boy. They says that it can be either. I searched her name in Google & found it's SCAM. LUCKILY! i did not communicated further.

Within 1 hour I got a reply as 

'Thank you for  replying to me. I am XiaoJie Li, 37 years old, a simple and non-smoker lady. I am willing to rent the room. I am at sea at the moment as i work on a cruise ship as a Chef.

I will be living and working down there as my contract here is coming to an end that's why I am coming there. But due to the nature of my work of having a busy schedule, phone calls making and visiting of website are restricted, I only squeezed out time to check this advert and send you a message so I won't be able to come for the viewing myself.

I will like you to kindly calculate the total cost covering my first six months rent together with deposit and I will be staying for long as your room is available. 

Please kindly get back to me with some pictures of the room and your address for me to forward it to my mover agent to calculate the total cost of moving my stuffs over there. I have attached my IC with this email for you to have a view of me. Looking forward to read back from you soon so I can provide you with my WhatsApp number'

                Met this guy called Ryan Heng on CMB (coffee meet bagel) app in may 2019. claims the following:
- moved to los angeles from singapore when he was a teen. dad passed away, left with mom who lives in canada. 
- entrepreneur dealing in tech venture capital, after chatting on whatsapp daily for about two months , he said he won a contract with perenco oil and gas to construct an oil rig in turkey. sent me pic of the contract. 
- continued to talk on google hangouts while he was on the rig because IT security restrictions did not allow him to bring his mobile phone, so had to use a palmtop.
- told me he wanted to visit me in SG after completing the contract, talked about purchasing a property in sg and moving to sg because his mom was singaporean and wanted to move back to SG.
- one day in early sep 2019, asked me to do a favour to get 2 $100 ITUNes gift card for him to purchase apps as his anti-virus is outdated. i did not think twice and got it for him.
- two days later, he claims one of the control panel on the oil rig was faulty and he needed to rent from a supplier in order to get the job completed before perenco board of directors come for final inspection. he directed me to a dodgy website to help transfer funds to two ukrainian individuals,. transfer did not go through and he asked if i could help  with the remaining balance of USD 7k as he only had USD23K with him. Supplier needed USD30K. this was when i realised it was a scam, as the website was very dodgy, did not look like a legitimate bank and google checks showed that the website was only 6 months old.  
- told him  i have no money and cannot help him.  confronted him but he did not admit. showed me his US passport to prove his identity which is likely fake. insisted that he will refund me the $200 once he got onshore. 
- throughout the chats, he shared many selfies of the same guy, most likely obtained from identity theft. plot was very elaborate. 
- in total, i lost SGD $200. valuable lesson learnt.

I told him that I did not send any parcel through dhl to Guangzhou then he told me there is a high possibility that someone used my name and contact number. he suggested me to make a police report so I asked him for the information of the parcel as shown below.

date: 23 august 2019, Friday

name of the person that shipped the parcel: wang wen

address: 2225 ang mo Kio avenue 18 S(569810)


after providing the information, he told me that this call will be recorded and he will divert the call to the Guangzhou police station (+862083116688). someone picked out the call and said that this is Guangzhou police station then I hung up the call.

after I hung up, I received a few missed calls from these numbers (+6596956931 and +6544677662).

                I wanted to get a camera and while i was doubtful about an advertisement that I saw online, I contacted the seller to find out more. 

The description asked me to contact seller on whatsapp.. so i messaged. he then asked me to do transaction directly as fast it will be. and he assured that i pay half.. he will deliver product and i pay the other half.. he said he is trustworthy (i dont know why i believed). next i transferred him 1000 sgd to his maybank account. next day he says he didn't receive the money yet and asked me status. but it was successful my side. so he said his boss was upset and asked me to send full amount (i was stupid to not understand now at least). then i transferred other amount. he said next day morning i will receive the product. 

next day morning he messaged me that  ****** ""It's very unfortunate that the Customs Authority still insisted not to release us your pending package in their custody after completing the insurance processes on your package. They further stated that your package has stayed beyond the normal permitted duration at the customs clearing yard and it has already been moved to their customs bonded warehouse terminal and they imposed customs bonded clearance fee of 1000 on your package.

NOTE: This payment is also refundable under the law sub section 32:31 of carriage. We will file for the refunds (1000) immediately upon your package delivery and the money will be sent back to you. You are advice not to delay the imposed customs clearance payment, so that your package final delivery can commence as already been re-schedule and in order to confirm you the delivery time."" *************

and asked me for another 1000 dollar. i said i already paid full.. customs is his problem. but he kept asking me more money.. which i didn't pay
but on top of this... at night he said he sent me a code and that if i give him the code i will receive the product. i didn't receive anything from him. he said it will be from lazada. then i received one from lazada and it said i'm registering as seller on lazada and this code was otp to confirm. i understood that he is scamming and i told him no way i give otp and i am going to police station. he was still trying to act as a good person that he was not scammer. i told i will go to police station and report and he was dont bothered with it. 

i reported in the police station.
I hope no one else would be scammed like this!!!! if this can help at least one person from getting scammed.. i will be thankful to god...

                i saw a post in carousell, posted by JOHNBLACK88 (also called ken), on ""luxury watch easy instalment plan"". 

on 15th Aug, i responded to it and gave my personal details, including my nric and bank details. then on that day, Ken whatsapp me to inform me that $400 ($120+$280) was transferred to my account and i had to transfer the money back to another bank account to him. I felt very suspicious as i was concerned that my account was used for unlawful activities. so i called him up to ask what was going on and that i was going to make a police report and to ask the bank to transfer back the money.

the police officer advised me not to transfer the money back to them, else i will be involved in loanshark activities and all my bank accounts could be frozen! Also to ignore them.

However, ken, together with his ""boss"", harassed me for a few days to transfer the money back to them, despite me telling them, that the bank would reverse the transfer back to them. hence, i blocked the number. They even used facebook to post messages demanding for the money back!
they even used another number (+60 17-5631260) to message me, threatening to ""whack my family"" and burn my ""neighnorhood house"".
eventually the bank reversed the transfer on 22 aug, however, threatening messages were still posted on my facebook to demand the money back!
they sounded to be in their early 20s and have Malaysian Chinese accent

From this incident, i think it is important to stand firm and to ignore and to block their number. 
all their threats have been empty talks and very ridiculous with a poor command of English.
examples:
a) telling me that he will be ""coming from Malaysia"" to whack me: 
- I was wondering why must he tell me that he was coming ""from Malaysia"", to go custom to welcome him?
b) to burn my ""neighnorhood house""
- should be my house right, and so ridiculous, over S$400! i wonder what i can ask him to do with $500!


my word of advice:
Stand firm! ignore and block their numbers!

                do not believe in any loan offer via sms or media social. i had a painful experience which cause my life in mess now!


due to financial issue, i had approached the guy - derek after receive a sms on the loan offer.

at first, he said his company will transfer 700 to me but return with 1000 as defer to have account with them. subsequently, in order to get the loan, i need to open file and open account in their company and it cost another 4000. when the money transferred, he told me the account had hit late payment. i need to pay another 2800 to activate the account.


lastly he ask me to transfer another 5400 to his company as they want to purchase insurance for me which i decided to cancel the deal. in the end i transferred 5000 as cancellation fee. But he told me i still need to transfer 4000 to cancel the file and account in his company which i refuse to do and start suspect i might get into loan scam.


i had keep asking them for the legal document but the person keep telling me they are legal and all is record in system.

When i mentioned i will report police and told them they are different from other legal lender. he told me they are different cause they are under tele-marketing and start to voice up to me.


In the end, I had called the company which derek quote and the person in charge told me i had get into scam as their company will not loan money thru any apps.


i had make a police report on this and also inform my family member to aware if anyone call them and disturb them.

lost money is painful, but if family member get hurts from this will be more painful.


i had my lesson and hope you all take it as a warning. don't fall into loan scams!

chatted close to a month and poof, he states that the mud machine in the oil rig project he is working with knpc in kuwait currently broke down and need me to send money for the delivery fee to the seller in turkey and state it will take around 3 days to reach kuwait.

He can contact the seller to provide the whole bank details but not able to contact anyone from his company to assist…

WHATSAPP SELLER ON PURCHASE nevertheless to find out more.Request for cod but seller indicate that ""accept payment first before delivery Via Transfer or Cash Deposit Payment into Our Company POSB Account"" and shared a lot of photos  happy buyer who had made purchased.

asked to cash and carry from their shop, but was rejected and indicate ""Sorry we ONLY do delivery & we accept payment first before delivery"".

asked on how to be assured that the item will be delivered upon payment, was shown a name on a passport that does not show up anywhere on their websites.

insist on cod, but was replied ""No sorry we don't deal like that so you can go buy elsewhere or take your money to go buy in a nearby store close to you instead since you still don't feel secure enough buying from us okay""

Scammer called around lunch time to say that I will be deported as they have received a notice that Indian High Commission. I was asked to log into a website to register my details and I am not to take this call lightly. 
I asked him how he got my contact details and his name. He said he was calling from Foreign Affairs Office and I was asking too many questions. I asked him for the reasons for my impending deportation. He accused me of taking his call lightly and it’s a serious matter. When probed more, he simply hung up.

I received a call from dhl saying that i have a package sent from changi airport to beijing dong cheng qu, jin bao jie 90 on 18 aug 2019. The dhl person linked me to a call from china police as i need them to issue a note that i didnt send the package. Then i talked to this person called tian zhengyu who then told me, after searching my name in their database, i was involved in an international money laundering scandal, in which the mastermind was called zhang jia bao. He showed me a document signed by pm lee hsieng looong, stating how sg officers and high ranking officials are involved in this money laundering scandal so i cannot go to the sg police. They also showed how sg police managed to give all the power and authority to china police. Worst thing is i could not hang up the call as they said they have china officers in singapore who can detain me and deport me to china for investigation for 45 days. I was really scared and asked how to verify my identity and i gave my nric, passport number, the cards i have and their last 4 digits, how many bank accounts i have and estimated how much money i have. I was not thinking straight and gave all to them, not my bank ac number though. I didnt lose any money as i found out after over 10 hours on the whatsapp call with him, when i decided to tell my friend who told its 1000% a scam. I just hung up and made a police report.

                Hi,
I had purchased a deal in Carousell from a user called ""missjjy"".
The deal is about ""MBS Complimentary Stay 1 Night Only"". The deal was quoted for S$200 and I purchased it for the same price.
On 14th August, I had a chat with the seller and we both agreed with the deal. I Made an Offer in Carousell. The seller asked me to make a deposit of S$50 to reserve the item.
I asked the seller to exchange phone numbers so that we can be more comfortable. The seller mentioned that she is currently overseas and can contact via singapore whatsapp number 9468413?. Alternatively,  can contact whatsapp via her work phone +660993799588. I shared my contact details too.

Then I transferred the deposit to her OCBC Account (which was shared) and the seller acknowledged the same. 

Now, we were communicating over whatsapp. The seller reserved the item and shared screenshot with me. Then on 15th August seller got the deal under my name and shared a sms with Ref No blanked out. This convinced me and I had transferred the remaining amount too.  The seller has been delaying every day giving some reason or other to share the complete reference  number details with me... sometimes saying that it is other mobile which is in hotel... sometimes saying that she requested for an email acknowledgment and will share soon.
Few days later, she deleted the item from Carousell instead of marking it sold.
From yesterday onwards, she is not responding to any of my communication. Her SG number is also not available. There is no response to whatsapp calls, whatsapp chat and carousell chats

He mentioned that i have SENT a parcel of 8 fake passport overseas and that I need to make a report to the china police. He linked me up to THe china police number and i made a report. He told me that since its a phone call, he would need to let me verify the legitimacy of his police post through online search ""Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau Chayang BRANCH"", in CHINESE ( ). I did THAT, and saw in one of their REVIEWS that it was a SCAM. 

After that he WENT on to prove his identity as a police officer by sending me his police iD. Knowing that the review could be true, I search the net and (to my horror) found similar cases of impersonation SCAMS . After which, I ended the call (with him asking me to go over china to look for him in person if I was so unsure who to TRUST). It was in total an hour worth of call.

He tried to ask me how much I am earning indirectly and sounded less keen after knowing that I do not earn that MUCH. Don't be fooled by them

Hence, the DHL PERSONNEL transferred me Singapore police who mentioned that my case is to be reported to the china branch police station in order to close the file etc. then i was greeted by this man call “offIcer wang Zhi Gang” from Pudong Branch, shanghai municipal public security bureau. they said they will help me to check on the package and write a statement to Singapore police that i am not the one who sent the parcel. 

After that i I’ve been accused of using a bAnk account under “china constructEd bank” to do money laundering with this malaysia ministry or something named 。The has been caught by them And he Said this guy said i have been given a Amount of money to sell my Personal information to them. Also The whole process of information taking is done through video call Like how Police officer interroGaTing the Suspects, i have to be in a secluded Room and i shouldn't inform any of the family members. In the end i did not lost any money, just most of my personal information has been given. Feel so dumb for trusting them but they are so real. Please beware

                I posted an ad about looking for work from home jobs on gumtree. someone contacted me by introducing himself as ""boon"" and he is from ""rebox sg"". he offered $600 weekly for me to post ads on social media and websites. the ad include pictures of apple iphone xr 128gb for the price of sgd 650 and iphone x 256gb for the price of sgd 700. i posted the ad on carousell as instructed. about half an hour later, a carousell user warn me about the scammer. He insisted on me calling the number (boon) using normal line. i tried calling and realise that the number was a deadline. i was able to reach him via whatsapp call and messages. i was lucky that someone reached out before anything happened. i deleted all my ads immediately. i hope there were no money lost by the victims.

Editor's Note: The company wrote in to NCPC to clarify that ""Boon"" wasn't a staff at the company. The scammer impersonated as staff of the company to cheat.

                Received SCAM call from China DHL branch automated service (phone number: 9993 1687), then connected to an actual Chinese speaking phone operator. In Chinese the Operator told me that my phone number was associated with a parcel that contained 8 counterfeit passports, that was sent from Singapore to Chao Yang, Beijing. They took down my Chinese name and my first name. I told them I had nothing to do with this. They told me that if I really had nothing to do with this, I should let the Beijing Seaport Security Authorities know directly. In the meantime, they gave me the airway number of the parcel CL69238080DE, the sender's address ""Singapore 160056"" as well as the intended recipient name and address: Mr. Fong Zhen, #18 Chao Yang Qu, Meng Wai Da Jie, phone number: +86 13213065371. At this point I was still not sure if it was a scam, so when he asked if he could connect me to the Chinese officials that deal with such parcels, I said ok. He connected immediately to Officer Ling En. He asked me why I was calling and explained that he was the Chinese Sea Port authority dealing with sea freight packages and that my phone number was on a parcel that contain the counterfeit passports. I said yes, DHL informed me and asked me to speak to you, how do I deal with this? He said that this was a very serious issue and that according to Chinese law, I had to physically go to the office in Chao Yang Beijing to do a recorded interview / deposition, explaining that I had nothing to do with this parcel - this was the only way to clear my name. I said that is 100% impossible, as I live in Singapore and that I was not going to fly anywhere to do this. He said it's ok, we can reschedule the deposition timing to Monday, 19 Aug 2019 at 11am and everything can be done on the phone. I asked why they didn't want to have black and white email correspondence? and Officer Ling En said that that is not how they do it in China. Everything will be done over the phone with his superior next Monday and that recording will serve as evidence that I am not involved in this. I said ok and then hung up. I googled the airway bill and it did not turn up on the DHL website; I then googled for ""SCAM CHINA DHL"" and found out that more than 200 people had received this call as well, where DHL China tells them that their phone number is associated with a rogue parcel containing 8 counterfeit passports. I then knew for sure that it was a scam, and I will not be taking the call on Monday. Worried about the fact that they have my Chinese name and first name in English and also worried that others will face the same scam and give up personal information.

Don't be fooled into releasing info over the phone!

                I was in urgent need to get some money to pay off my debt. i received a sms from a guy name eric wong saying that i can get s$15k loan with 20 months installment. 

thus i approached him and gave my nric and cpf contribution statement to him as requested. he was saying that in order to get the loan, i need to make one time transfer to make sure i have a record in his company. i gave him my bank account number and he transferred s$360 to my account  follow with a message saying 600 clear defer 200 5 days. he asked to transfer back s$200 to him 5 days later and the next day i will need to go down his office to sign off the loan contract. 

5 days later, he contacted me with a posb saving account and asked me to transfer the s$200 to the account. i did the transfer and next day i was asking him when can go down his office to sign contract. he gave me all the excuses saying holiday period and his boss not in, so cant process the loan yet. then 5 days later, he called me again saying i need to make another test payment of $200 because my loan application couldn't go through. at this point of time, i already suspicious about this loan scam and refused to transfer another $200. i straight off closed my bank account that used for this transaction.

I STARTED TO IGNORE HIS MESSAGES AND PHONE CALL. he  called my office number several times to look for me and saying that i owe him money but never return. then he sent threatening photo of mine and NRic saying that i cheat his money and make sure i will lose my job. on the same night, i lodged a police report about this loan scam. i also deposited another $400 to his bank account so called to clear the $600 loan and blocked off his number. hope everyone out there beware on this loan scam and dont ever fall into this.

                Met a Korean guy( alan feng) on Cmb app. He said he own a mining company in perth and work under GIa. We got into relationship online in march.
Was given his bank account to help him on some bank transaction as he is on a cruise exhibition where there is no good wifi. Then he claim that before his final stop in greece, he has to deliver item that he bought onboard to avoid the 100% vat tax. I told him that i do not have the money and he said that all i have to dO is to recieve. 
So when the parcel got struck at china custom, the diplomat called and ask to pay for the tax. He then say use his acct to transfer the money, which i did. However it will took 10 working days to transfer. So at the same time i also used his acct to transfer to myself. And since i am the one doing the transfer i thought that it was legit. And i pay up the tax on behalf on him thinking that the money will return to me. But the bank website was then down and i am unable to access the web. Then he said that he is coming to singapore and have a valid hotel invoice. And when he touch down sg , he claim that he was held by the sg police custody as he was charged by  tiffiany & co (his client) for not able to deliver his project. And he say that his laywer will transfer the money, but i doubt so. A painful lesson for me. Be ware..

After checking he told me that I have some parcel that contain illegal item such as passport and some identification item been held at china sorting center. He then process to ask me to pay a fine and told me not to pretend for not knowing it. Then I told him are you a con artists organization and he hang up the phone straight away.

                I got a call from this number +65966868 and +1 (800) 391-6150 on 8th August 2019  and he said he is calling from ICA, they said they received a legal dispute from consulate of india on me and they requested the passport details, CURREnt ADDRESS. i shared them actually sinCE they threatened that if i do co-operate, They will immediately deport me back to my country. they somehow knew my personal details beforehand (I don't know how), but it got me scared.

Also they waited me in the line for 10 mins and said your records are very clean in singapore. But in india we will receive it by next 72 hours. For that next 72 hours, if you want to stay in singapore, you have to pay $4000 as a security deposit else leave to india immediately. the other two options which he gave me was either get deported to india immediately (and I cannot come to singapore for the next 15 years) or spend 72 hours BEHIND the bar as criminal. THEY ALSO SAID TO GO TO ANY SEVEN ELEVEN OR CHALLENGER STORES AND ASK FOR APPLE I-TUNES CARD WORTH 4000 SGD AS A SECURITY DEPOSIT AND ONCE MINE BACKGROUND CHECK IS CLEAR FROM INDIA THEY WILL REFUND. 

THEY SAID NO YOU HAVE TO FOLLOW THE PROTOCOL AND HE WANTS ME TO DO WHAT HE IS SAYING and kept on talking in a loud voice (in order to scare).

I said  i will come in person to ICA will all my documents, but they said you are not following the protocols and kept forcing me to but i-tunes from seven eleven. 

REALIZING it as a scam i  SAID I WILL COME TO ICA BUILDING DIRECTLY and disconnected the call and SWITCHED off my phone. AFter about half an hour I switched on again only to get the same call again and again (they even tried to reach me for 20 times when my phone was off)

I didn't lose any money, but my passport number and address details pass number i have shared with them.

Was told by the scammer that i mailed a package that was stuck at beijing airport. told him not possible - i wasn't even in the country on the day the package was allegedly mailed. was told the package contained a book and 8 bank cards, which is illegal. upon hearing that i wasn't even in the country, scammer said i was probably a victim of identity theft. he told me that i needed to make a report to beijing police to be able to send or receive packages in the future. scammer gave me the date and time that the package was ""mailed"", as well as the recipient's name and address in beijing. he also wanted me to take down his name and employee number. he then wanted to transfer me to the authorities in beijing to make my police report. 

i asked if he could give me a number so i could call at a later time, or if i could have someone else who speaks Mandarin better than i do make the report on my behalf. was told this was not possible since i would have to make the report myself. he refused to give me any contact information for the ""Beijing authorities"", and said his supervisor would transfer my call directly to Beijing if i could stay on the line. i hung up once he put me on hold.

I then contacted her after i reached the location. And she asked for my number  THEN A GUY NAMED “” CALLED ME AND explain that I JUST NEED TO ANSWER SOME SECURITY QUESTIONS TO CONFIRM THAT I WASN'T AFFILIATED WITH THE POLICE and that i will have to walk over to the AXS machine next to the posb atm machine to buy sgd$100 worth of Alipay credits to pay her as she didn't want any cash transactions for the first meeting. 

So i did buy RMB$500 and keyed in the email address that she provided ( [email protected] ) .

after paying I was asked to make 3 other payment of sgd$600 security deposit and to make sure i wont harm or nab the girl. Again stupid me, i bought the credits again. He then again told me he needed another 3 receipt for refundable deposit of Sgd$600. And I was able to negotiate AND made a payment for 1 receipt of sgd$600 and also was given a dateline to make payment for the rest of the 2 receipt payment.

I have cleared all my savings to pay for all the deposit and I lost my temper with him AND I started hanging up his call and he started to threatened me that if i make any nonsense He would ask his “brothers” to come to my house and harass my family. He then gave me a deadline to make payments. In the end, I went To file a police report online

Then she ask me to add she on line and suddenly asked if i want to meet and offered her services for $100/2hrs or $300/day because she was in need of money. She asked me that since this was my first time with her, the payment for the service would be made via alipay. After i made the transfer, a man （）called me form unknown number. He asked me send mine id to the girl for make sure i’m not a police 
After i send it , he called me again and told me to pay an additional s$1200 as ""assurance fee"" to ensure that i am not the police. 
After i paid well then came in another request to pay another s$1200 as ""protection fees"". And after i paid , he request to pay another s$1000 as ""hotel fee""when i told him that there is no way i am going to pay that amount, he asked me to go borrow money.
After 1week i paid to he and now came in another request to pay more s$1000 as ""assurance payments fee"". But i have no more money i and told he after 1month
And few day ago i saw a news that a singaporean get scam over s$9000 then i think i also get scam, the man called me again yesterday
I lost a total of $3,600 to this credit-for-sex scam.

                It was an automated voice message from a lady speaking in Mandarin claiming to be from ICA, saying something relating to my pass/permit. There's a number option to press to connect to another person.

The recorded voice message repeated twice and will disconnect if you did not respond. When I tried calling back, i found that it's an invalid number. 

The phone number used was 89981039. Beware of this call.

                I got to know a guy from Coffee Meets Bagel (CMB) and his name is John Cheng Williams. He claimed to be a American, a mixed, father is from Poland, mother is from Singapore, both deceased now. He is a single child, divorced with no kid.

He works in Dubai as a freelance rig engineer, will be coming to Singapore in Jul19 to join Sembcorp Marine after his project in dubai ends. he wants to settle permanently in Singapore and settle down with me. he plans to get a condo in orchard rd. he is facing problem with his mudpump machine and needs to order one from china and cargo ship to the rig so that he can complete the project and start new job in singapore. he has problem in accessing his us bank account to pay the china supplier as internet access is restrictive at the rig site. he can do whatsapp call but not able to video call as internet is weak there.

He told me he has stopped using the app since knowing me however I saw him deleted our chat a week later. I decided to pay a fee to be the premium member and I am able to see Bagel’s activity. He is still using the app that is why I am confused.

I was ignorant of not knowing the existence of sg scam alert website until one day I searched the net for possible scammer traits until I found out this website (more relevant and more real cases) which helped me to find out and TRUTH and THANKFULLY I did not lose anything as I already know his plot. 

I managed to find 2 similar stories of this person from the cases shared by 2 other persons on ScamAlert. 

I would have been one of the victim if I did not read the stories above. It hurts though to find out the person I had been chatting so intimately every day is actually a scammer!

It was pretty coincident of her place to also be near mine. It was a scam tactic as they asked mine First, making it convenient for me. 

She suggested 7-11 which raised my 1st doubt. I asked for some reason and she says will pick me up, which is unusual. Nonetheless I still went ahead. 
When I reach, she says her friend will call me and do verification. Ah Kun called and asked me to go axs to transfer thru alipay as the lady cannot take cash transaction due to her student pass. 2nd doubt. 

While keying in the gmail needed to transfer, there is a big alert on the screen ""Do Not send to other email as your pin will be release"". Then I stop the transaction and i told Ah Kun I am cancelling as it is unsafe for me. He got angry and shouted. I hang up on him and then received violent video from the meng qi and threatening msg on tracking me down. 
I proceeded to delete my line account and change to private for my social account and whatsapp.

Lady Miss tan, replied to the mail stating she wants to secure the place if it is available.


She stated that she is a Singaporean , currently working in Germany. She wishes to come back to  Singapore to work there and needed a place by 10th August, 2019.


I informed that I may not move out before september and  If She needs the place , we  can make some arrangements. SHe agreed to move in September once I vacate. I was contented to have solved that  issue easily


She asked me the exact address where I stay so that she can ship her luggage to that address. I  furnished her with the same.


She provided me with her NRIC number   S763620?E and asked me to share a payPal account so that she can transfer the deposit. She forgot the online bank details so insisted to use paypal.


I  requested her to use whatsapp/ messenger/etc so that communication can get easier. However, she denied stating  that email is a good way to keep record.


before  creating paypal account,  I  somehow happened to google and find out It is a scam. Be wary of such scam! Even though they provided a picture of the i/c, it can be photoshop-ed and may not be theirs!

                I got a trouble with unlicenced money lender. At first i dont know that is illegal company. I want to borrow some money because I needed to send money to my family. 

I approached this company after that i gave all my address and phone number,ID, Payslip,bank acc, house address, house owner number, and i requested to loan.

At first, they said i needed to do a 'test' payment, so they transferred me $220(actually they have to transfer $300 then they cut of admin feed$40 and processing fee$40 so they transfer $220) after that i have to transfer back $490. 

If this one was done, my 8000 loan would be approved. After, i transferred they say i need to make payment again this time they sent $250 and i needed to send back $490. I sent second time again. Then not approve after that they said I need final payment again they will send $250 and i need to send back $490 for confirm approval. Then after all this i done i can get. I transferred that $490 for final and also i did not get any loan he said my loan is on hold and I am entitled to get weekly loan only. I said that i don't need weekly loan and if u cant process plz help me refund my money $700.

So, he said to wait for 80 days to get refund. So, i waited. Then today he said again i can get my loan request. Then, he did a video call and asked me show my id also. So i did it. After that without ask me anything he send $120 to my account and asked me send back $880. 

Also sent agreement after he done transaction. I said that i cant make any payment to u. Then the problem started, he called my landlord, my supervisor and said that i borrowed money from him and never pay back. Also he send threatening videos and my video call photo that he screen shot.

                Vendor advertised Huawei P30 Pro cellphone for sale at SGD500 on lazada website. after some enquiries on the website, the vendor asked to chat on whatsapp. I did so and after further enquiries, i was directed to make direct payment to his account, and not through lazada.

ABOUT SIX HOURS after i made the internet funds transfer, he whatsapp me that i need to pay another $395 for tax and insurance to ensure safe delivery to my doorstep as the product is on hold at customs. this will be refunded to me subsequently.

i refused as i suspected that i had been scammed. i called POSB to ask if my payment could be reversed but was told to make a police report, which i have made.

i checked the lazada website again and this time the misleading advertisement is no longer there.

I received an SMS message stated no late fee charge and $185 monthly for 60 months for a loan of 10k, so i started to enquire about it. After taking my particulars and says need to do a test loan before the 10k loan to be approved. The test loan is to transfer $700 and 5 days after i have to pay 1k and they will return back after the loan is approved. So, on the 5th day, they sent me a message to transfer the $1k loan before it would be approved in 15mins. After I have transferred the $1k, the manager called to inform me that the ‘rules’ have changed and I need to pay an admin fee of about $1.5k first and said the company will be reimbursed upon loan approval. The company kept saying that these ‘fees’ will be returned to me upon loan approval. This is just a scam and there is no ‘loan approval’ at all. They even threatened me! Hope that no one will get scammed by them!

I made a  report to lazada and an online police report. A police officer called and said that they basically cannot take any action because no money was lost. Be careful everyone!

                hi, i would like to remind everyone to be extra careful when dealing with strangers met in online dating apps. 

firstly, i was a victim that was blinded by sex and due to my desire to have first time experience on it i became desperate and landed into a trap from the scammer. i met this girl called li ping which proclaimed that she was from hong kong and she told me to met her at sengkang shell petrol station at 9pm. i was then told to buy taobao credit of $200 worth before we meetup. after doing so, she told me to buy another $200 worth of taobao credit again for safety. i was then alerted from her when she told me to call her boss to arrange for a meetup with me. after which, i called and her boss told me to buy $1000 worth of taobao credit as a protection in case i bullied or hurt the girl which i find it ridiculous. but i decided to buy an extra $200 worth of taobao credit again to called it a close. but the boss was not happy and i told him that i had no money due to being a student as well. the boss decided to lower it to $500 worth, but i have already made up my mind not to pay anymore money to them and decided to ignore all the calls and messages from them. they are furious and the boss threaten to hurt my family members and even send someone to ASSAULT me in the future. in total, i lost $600 and in return had a painful lesson learnt.

Then the next morning i search with keyword “lovescammer” and found this web and read the story shared here. From here, I found his another instagram acct. i have remove him from my instagram but not yet on my whatsapp. 

I wanted to know what is he going to do with me? I informed female-followers who like his photos to be aware of him and to be surprised, his other follower also shared same experienced. This make me confirmed that he is a love scammer. Characteristics of love scammer: 

1. Avoid to do face call 
2. His account is newly accounted with minimize photos.
3. His profession is either engineer, work in military, busy businessman. 
4. All his follower are women, not even a man. 
5. They are not really follow your post even they talk all sweet thing about us. 

His Whatsapp is always inactive and only active when they contact you.

                Got to know this guy on okcupid,  a dating website.  he professes his interest for me and soon took our conversation to Wechat.  he says he is a Singaporean but was living in Canada with his mum and planning to come back soon to Singaore as his contract is ending soon.


We voice call a couple of times  and i even requested to video call,  but before i could even ask,  he says he dropped his phone and it cracked and he was unable to video call me.


Hence he told me he wanted to buy a condo in Queenstown.  His boss in Canada was the one who recommanded him the agent.  however in order to secure the price  which was an initial of $1.5million  to $950k,  the home owner requested him to put a down payment of $350k.


However he claimed his account got blocked by the bank in Canada as he transferred out a large amount of money.  he appeared to be be sad and frustrated that he was unable to transfer the rest of the amount out.  this morning,  he messaged me exclaiming that his boss managed to rain 45k  and adding in and 4k,  which his mum raised,  its now a total of 49k.


He then requested me to help him send the money to the owner through my account  and at the same time,  lending him another 1 k  as he was short of it.


I blocked him after that.  he was probably going to use my bank account as a money mule  and at the same time cheat me of 1k.

                I met this guy by the name of Michael Shun Lee via coffee meets bagel. He liked my profile first, so I just liked back to see how things goes. He introduced himself as a supervisor at a R&D institutes and also a business entrepreneur. His profile location shows him in Singapore but during the chat, he said he is a Korean but raised in Morpeth Northumberland in UK and he is based there. He said that he has been living in UK for 20+ year but his English is kind of weird.


We started with in-app Chat, then moved to WhatsApp, chatted almost daily asking each other on our well-being. About 1 week after we chat, he confessed to me and said had bought me gifts. I felt weird but end up still giving him my address. I have no idea what he bought because he said it was a surprised for me. He showed me a picture of the posted parcel. Also told me that he left some money inside to pay for the delivery fee and clearance fee.


So, the courier service contacted me to verify the delivery details and alert me to pay a clearance fee of SGD1,000. Later, they informed me that they found money inside in the parcel, USD 11,500. And out of unknown regulation, they need to exchange that money to SGD and wanted to charge me a currency exchange fee of 1.3K. I went to the bank, wanting to remit the money. Luckily, the banker stops me telling me the remittance should NOT be going into a personal account.


I informed him and the courier service that I cannot remit the money. Both sides start to get angry with me for being ungrateful! I was totally speechless. I was kind of angry and stop responsing. He then tries to act like I break his hearts and stuff. I got a little soft-hearted so tried to add that account given by the courier service as Payee online. This time round, the bank app rejected the swift code they provided. I informed the courier service. No reply. I told him. He asked me to use Western Union. I said it was not convenient to me. Instead, I ask him to remit the money on my behalf. He said no because he had already left the money inside the parcel. From then, I stopped replying him and blocked both contacts.


I have this feeling that both him and the courier service are partners in crime. He actually sided the courier service when I told him about the bad attitude they were giving me. Btw, he said that he engaged WORLDWIDE COURIER SERVICE but was not able to provide me a tracking number when I ask for it.


Really thankful to the banker and the app. I hope my story will create awareness for others.

Today I had an appointment at ICA for my PR application confirmation. Within 15 mins of completing my appointment with ICA, I received a call from someone who attempted to impersonate as ICA officer. Surprisingly, this scammer knew my name and that I’ve just had an appointment with ICA.. He addressed me by my name and asked me to meet him privately near ICA to discuss some urgent matters. The person said that this call was about my impending deportation. I knew this was a scam call and hung up immediately.

Please beware of unknown calls even if they call you by name and do not divulge your personal information at the first instance.

I got the call from an Indian guy with the number 64385128 and he mentioned that he is calling from ICA immigration office. He was asking how long i have been in Singapore and if i have violated anything back in India. Apparently, i am not from India and i have never been there. I hanged up and he called again and even speaking to someone using their language. 

Then i asked again what is he representing, he never answered back so i told him that he is a scam and he hung up.

Fake tenant alert! Li xiaojie working as a chef in cruise. Foolishly gave my paypal details and contact number to her because she provided her on whatsapp number! 

Whatsapped her and here are her claims 
i am stationed on the system now about to get the payment done, i need a kind favor from you and i will be happy if you can sort it out for me 
i was just about to pay when i received an email from my shipping company, my shipping agent says i will need to pay for the moving before they can ship my items, they charge me $400 sgd for pick up and delivery and payment for pick up will be made to the corporate international headquarters in philippines. 
The payment is to be made through moneygram money transfer. I will add $400 sgd to my to my rent deposit that i will transfer to your paypal account which you will kindly help me to send the excess $400 sgd to them 

right from the start, it was somehow fishy because i insisted her to view but she gave excuses that she wanted to secure her room. Once when ive given her my paypal details via whatsapp, she wanted me to pay the mover fee via Moneygram and i told her to do it by herself lol. Now it appears to really be a scam. Have not blocked her on whatsapp yet but maybe soon... 

If only i have googled her name before wasting my time to engage with her grandma stories!! Landowners, beware of her! Because I’ve given her my paypal details, i decided to close my account to prevent any hacks etc. 

Her profile pic on whatsapp is exactly the same face as on ic. Do not be fooled

After i did so, a Chinese woman asked me is there anything she might help while i said i received a call from their side. then she just mentioned that i might have unclaimed parcel and requested my name for her to check. i did mentioned the surname in Mandarin and name in English. without providing any tracking number details, she said I have unclaimed parcel from China, Shanghai, and asked for time that I was available for them to deliver the parcel. as i said i work from 7am to 7pm, she said she will inform the delivery man to contact me during lunch time (without asking what is my rest time) to discuss the time for delivery. besides, she said their side contacted me for few times before but couldn't reach me, but in fact i never received any emails/messages/calls regarding this issue.

                This guy named Albert added me on instagram and introduced himself raised In Cortland united state but born in hongkong taipu. He wanted to befriend me . Within two weeks, he confesses his love for me and wanted to be in relationship. He said he is independent contracted as safety consultant for petrochemical company. After three weeks, he mentioned he got new contract so need to go Mexico for 6 weeks. After this he will come to Singapore to be with me for future plan. 

During our daily interactions, he sent me his pictures and video. He also calls me via Whatsapp daily. He sounds loving and caring in order to gain my trust. Before leaving for Mexico, he said he wanted to send me a gift. I gave him my address and name. After that i realized he sent me 4 hand bags, a set of jewelry, perfume sets, prada leather Watch and two set of clothes. 

I was shocked to see these items in the package as they are really expensive stuff and his courier was US1,400. He told me the total value of his gift was worth US$14k . That is crazy right ? I have sensed it is like a scam so i checked The shipping company website and found it normal. Until the day i received whatsapp from sg phone no to informed me to pay $5500 for taxes and clearance. 

This agent did not give me any name or account. I called this number but it was no longer in use. I informed Albert but he asked me to pay on behalf and claimed back the parcel. Even returned to sender i also need to pay for the clearance . After that, he cut off all contact. I found out that his contact number was also fake. The courier Website : www.routeni?.com is also a fake website. 

Albert's WhatsApp is no longer active. That makes me strongly believe it is love scam! Luckily, I didn't pay for anything or fall in love with him. Be careful! Now it is possible to get fake us phone nUmber just for WhatsApp.  Sending gift in short time after getting know you is also weird, even if the person mentioned that he will eventually visit you. 

Many fakes daily life photos and video easily get u to trust but better to make videocall first. Anyway ladies, pls do not easily trust stranger blindly and give them any personal details. Use your wisdom or share stories with your friends to fight against love scam.

He addressed me wrongly first. Then with his more STERNNESS in voice tried to frighten me saying i'm calling from ica, where are you at moment work place or home? I replied back saying ""home"". Then he said in more heavy and angry tone to make me feel like a culprit of something big of which i had no idea! he asked me to come to some distant private place. I repeated my reply that i'm home. And that pissed him and he shouted that i ask you to come to some private place?! than he asked in same insulting tone how long have you been in singapore and all?
I replied - first of all the way he was talking was not acceptable and ica would never make a cal in person and even in case he had been calling from ICA, he would have all the details of my stay in singapore along with fin and all details that he had been asking. Now for my safety reasons and against your rude BEHAVIOR in any case i would like to record this call as i strongly feel this is a scam call! and he hung up!!

                I was unemployed for 2 months and in need of a cash then a text message with an ad from ""JenseN"" was sent to me. I was in desperate need, so i whatsapp the number 85799501 with my enquiry. ""JenseN"" asked for my NRIC and CPF Contribution. The same night, he transfered $400 to me saying ""Take 400 clear 600 defer 200 5 day loan"" so on the 5th day, i paid $200 (thinking that as long as I pay $200 3 times, it'll add up to $600) but wrong, they want me to transfer $600 to ""clear"" it. So for that phase, I lost $800. ""Jensen"" said the admin will call me for my loan. I was in desperate need, so I pushed thru.

Upon paying the Defer $200 and Clear $600, the ""TMC Financial"" ADMIN Whatsapped me saying I need to transfer $550. the exact text message was ""$550 (APPROVE CHANGE/AGREMENT CHANGE"" so stupid me went to transfer the money. after that he messaged me saying ""SISTER WHY U IN 550 ONLY?!"" So agreement change is 550 and approve change is 550. that's $1100. I was so stressed as I needed the loan money and this people are asking for more. so I transfered another 550. i even asked him nicely if that was the last payment. he said yes. They keep using voice recording on whatsapp.

After that, the ""admin"" was asking that he will transfer me $6500 (My 5k loan + 1500 - my money that i transfered to them). after that, he messaged me ""my boss says need to buy insurance"" and that's when I lost it. I told them I won't be paying the ""insurance"" coz it's $840. I was texting him back with my discontentment and he even offered to pay half of the insurance so I can get my ""loan"" 

i lost a total of $1500. I'm going to report them to the police so I started researching and here I am writing this. i just hope i can get my money back.

I just HUNG UP and tried to call back using another phone but is unavailable (unable to go through). i went to google for the number but couldn't find any results until i reach this website and realized that other people also experienced this and that it's a scam.

He said that i received the call because i had shipped a package out from Changi airport on 1st july. when i denied doing so, he enquired if anyone had access to my identification documents, and i suspect that if i had not hung up, he would have asked for my I/C number etc. 

The initial call was from 8802 2038. After it got cut off midway i received a call from the same man from 8400 3773

                I visited this site after being fearful and saw several other similiar stories. 

So, I came across this girl called Xuan on Locanto, offering massage service. added her on wechat.

She said she was available and asked me to meet her at people's park. When i reach there, she say a guardian will call me to ensure the safety of her. then the guy call and explain to me first timer need pay through Alipay on AXS. when i declined to, he was nice and say just one time. but then after i made the payment of $150, he brought up the fact that i need to pay a safety deposit which is $1200. initially i thought it was remembered so i say ok, but at this point i was very fatigue from negotiating with him. through this whole time, he was on the phone with me. but when i was about to make the payment, i asked to confirm if it was rmb 1200 right, he grew mad and said its in Sing dollars and threatened to give me hell if I don't pay up. 

I lied to him that my phone has no batt soon, and i made the run to the nearest police station. i was in fear as i wasn't sure how much inform he has on me. 

The Police assisted me, told me the best way is don't engage. i blocked his whatsapp call and msg, his mobile calls are all unavailable, i cant block them, i can only turn on flight mode, i deleted the wechat msg to xuan, and he even SMS-ed which i just delete immediate. to be safe, i did a double check on my bank account, turn all my social media acct to private and turn my Whatsapp online status to private as well. i am not hoping to get back the money, i just pray for safety for my family and me and no disturbance from them soon.

                Alex befriended me on 2 Mar 2019 On IG to whatsapp. Few days later, he claimed to send me a parcel with important documents , luxury watch, a Dior bag and US$50K Cash. I was given a tracking no. On a fake Global Express Logistic (gel delivery) website. ALex emphasized that he must have the documents and cash when he comes to singapore after his marine Project for His business. I told him I will not accept the luxury gifts.  I Only help him to receive the parcel and cash on his behalf. 

An officer from choice financial Labuan texted me that the parcel and cash were confiscated at Malaysia Customs and needed me to pay various taxes to release. He also sent me a malaysian identity card, Tax receipts to convince me. within 2 weeks, I lost S$8K.  Alex claimed he’s a victim too, cheated by agent.

He asked my name, IC, and birthday. He said I sold a UOB card to a woman named meihua wang. I said i don't have UOB card, but only DBS.


In the end, i doubted him about his authority. He said you can come to the office. Then he hung up.

                I was working when I received an automated call stating (it was from ""DHL"") that I have an undelivered parcel at changi airport. Funny thing is, I haven't bought anything that requires a delivery. More suspiciously, after connecting to their officer, she only conversed in Chinese, kept asking for my particulars and insisting that I have a parcel (that their ""DHL"" correspondent never makes a mistake about parcel deliveries). when I requested for an English speaking officer, she hung up on me. :/

I was almost scammed by this guy on Instagram.
Recently i met a guy on Instagram, he insisted that i accept his friend request and that i follow him back too. However, he started chatting with me on Instagram and then therefore he ask me for my number. So we brought our chat to Whatsapp. He told me his dad was from Beijing and mum from Singapore. He is currently living and working in UK as an engineer. A few days later, he told me he wants to come Singapore to meet me after he settle his work.
A few days passed, he told me he bought me some gifts out of love and will send it to me through courier. He claims that he bought branded shoes and ring for both me and him. As he wants to marry me. He then passed me a tracking number and the website of the courier company.
However, out of curiosity i was wondering if this package even existed, so i messaged the courier company. After a few days, when the package was supposed to arrive in Singapore they told me i had to pay $2580 for taxes before they could deliver the parcel to Singapore from Indonesia.
I almost fell for it, but luckily i saw other similar stories that were reported as well.

                Knew Alex thru Paktor, quickly moved to whatsapp. Alex called me immediately to prove that he was real. 

Claimed he is offshore rig. Cannot make transactions. asked me to buy equipment which I didn't agree. Then, we chatted further, he said he is running low on data, so he requested usd200 but i bought usd100 amazon gift card. making plans to come see me but then said since it is private off time, company cannot pay for his air ticket, so requested i helped. i told him money is an issue for me and he said do not worry about it and ask me to write to his company as his fiancee. this is when the warning bell rang when  he asked me if i can buy the air tickets. so i started to read up more and realised the stories are all the same. haha. so yeah. anyway the original planning was to wait for his contract to finish and come visit me in singapore. then he said he has enough money to retire and no need more contract. this afternoon said he may consider taking up another contract if more work comes along his way. so yeah! scam alert to the max.

                I first received a missed call from the number 8184 2120. When i tried to call it back at 09:17, it failed, twice.

At 09:24, the number - 9357 3506, called me and I answered.

The phone call started off with a voice-automated message in Chinese (telling me that this is the final warning), upon which, prompted me to ""Press 9"" to speak to a customer officer.
A man who greeted me in Chinese, spoke to me and addressed himself as a worker from DHL.

I was alarmed when he told me that I had delivered a package on the 10th of June to Guangzhou, and that the package had been held up by them due to illegal materials.
As the call continued - he then told me he would transfer me over to the post office, in Guangzhou. A voice-automated message played again.

I believed shortly that it was the same guy, only in a slightly different setting. He asked for my name and age.

The call went on for about 30 minutes till it got very suspicious when he gave me instructions to add him on WeChat via the ID: SSGTGT1688 and he addressed himself as ""Bing Hai Min"". 
I then ended the call, and a number from Guangzhou, then called me 8 times, all of which I did not pick up. +86 (20) 8315 8000

                On Facebook I have come across this ad ""Brand new apple Wireless Airpods"" for SGD 150. listed by the user "" Lehcim M Olbap"". When contacted, they asked me to Whatsapp on +659083684?. 

After exchanging messages on whatsapp, they have confirmed this to be genuine and promised me that they don't take your money for nothing blah blah blah .. i have finally transferred the money of 150 SGD to have the item delivered to my home by 1 PM. I even confirmed how is the package delivered , is it by post or will they send some one from their company to delivery. They confirmed they will have someone from the company to deliver. 

After that,  to my horror, I get an email stating the customs official authority at the airport has already inspected and examined your package and they insisted to approve gst and insurance fee but not to commence now until the package gst and insurance fee is cleared...  and asked to pay 250 SGD more to another POSB Savings account 
Account no: 24953258?

by now you know that this is a scam and you have been royally cheated. The actual cost of Airpods is 290. Why on earth you will pay $400 for it?

After the transfer, she congratulated me for being the 100th buyer and have won a special discount promo to buy any 4 phones and pay half the price.

                Met a girl on locanto . . Sweet talker , chatted like a normal person. finally decided to meet at clementi mrt. then she would say she was on the way over to meet me. then asked if its okay for a friend to call me for verification. the next call as others went through would be to go to the nearest AXS machine to buy a 100sgd Alipay card. At this point i was reluctant 

I bought and gave it to them. Now I expected the issue to just be a scam and just wave my $100 dollars away. But no. Now they're calling me asking for $1200 for her protection fee and she would return to me in cash when meeting me. in case i was a police to catch her. now obviously 1200 is alot and it raised all the flags for me to get the hell out of there. then the girl via Wechat begged me to borrow money from a friend or anything. and knowing that they already took the Alipay money . which they more or less will take on the spot. i just gave up and asked them to keep the money.

Then the guy called back and threatened that he knew my phone number and could track me and my family will pay the price. so i just told him straight i don't have any money left. so i tell the girl that i would get the money in a few days. obviously at this point I won't pay . duhhh . 

Just to stall them. might just consider changing my phone number and be done with these nasty people. yes people don't trust what you see on classified websites.

I met a guy on coffee meets bagel app 3 weeks ago, claiming he wants to be friends. We chatted for 3 days on the app and he asked to exchange phone number. He persuaded me to give him my number to add on whatsapp because he on the coffee meet bagels app, the chat will expire in 7 days and he wants to continue to chat with me. He claimed he is from singapore and lives in uk westminster, lost his dad when he was young, and is working as an petroleum engineer in westminster, uk.

Via Whatsapp, he showed a lot of love and care, telling me constantly that he wants to marry me, and that his mom wants him to get married. He sends selfies of himself occasionally, and his pet dog jack. He is a real sweet-talker. He claims that he will come to Singapore to meet me.

After 3 weeks, he suddenly told me that he was trying to get a very important contract in Marine oilfield, in north sea. He went offline for 2 days. After that, he came back telling me that he got the contract, and is very happy and he believes that he got the contract because of me being in his life. 

He told me that he bought things for me to celebrate, will send it to me via courier. When i refused, he said he is driving to the courier company and it is a long drive from where he lives. In the end, i gave him my home address. He sent me photos of a luggage of bags, jewellery, iphone, and a secret brown envelope he said containing $20,000 usd. At that point, i realised he is a scammer because, who sends money via post? 

After 2 days, he sent me photos of Marine Oilfield, which i cannot see him in the photos. He told me that the contact is smooth and that the package will arrive singapore in 2 days as he called up the courier service to hurry up. He sent me a link to the courier service and a tracking no., i did not click on.
 This morning, I received a Whatsapp message. The message says “your parcel and consignment have arrived here in Singapore and you are required to pay 4,500sgd for duty import and singapore local charge. Mrs. You message me when you are ready to make your payment so that i can send your acct details to make the payment. And 2 continuous Whatsapp phone calls at 08:46am. I blocked the phone number from the courier service.

After not replying to the courier and blocking the courier number, the scammer whatsapp me saying “try to settle the payment, so that when they deliver to you, you can take the money i kept inside for you back.” I blocked him after that on whatsapp and phone number.

                I was in need of money at that point in time, I was lured by an ad that was sent to me by WhatsApp. On June 15, I went to inquire on the loan, the person asking for my particular, bank account number billing address and a copy of my ic number. 

At first, it was like normal information to approve the loan, in the beginning after they have a process they say they have a mini loan for me amount at $400 an in 5 days I need to clear back $600 for activation on the account. I did the transfer on the 5th day.

On the 5th day, I was asked to transfer they asked to transfer another $600 for admin fee/ GST and will refund when the loan is approved, yet again, I did a transfer for the admin fee with cash deposit machine. I thought it was alright given that I deposited money directly to the account. But oh boy I was wrong! Creditor claimed that they didn't receive the money and I need to redo one more time which is another $600.

So I did make another transfer and you know what they say, I have a penalty of $500 TO CLEAR BEFORE MY LOAN CAN BE APPROVED. Trouble started from this point on as  the creditor started making me feel like I was to blame for not doing the whole process correctly. So, I transfer the $500 penalty fee. 

After paying all this amount, the problem doesn't stop here, the creditor is still asking for more money with a reason that I need to activate my loan again which cost another $700, please be aware not to fall on this situation like me.

                It happened on 18 June 2019. I received a call from an individual claiming to be an ICA officer. He said he was calling to question some of VISA details as there were some issues. He started asking for how long I have been staying in Singapore. I sensed that this was a scam and responded that if he was indeed from ICA, he should have my records. He argued sternly saying that this is a questioning and I have to respond as there is a case registered under my name. When I enquired which office was he calling from, he disconnected the call. 

Learnt do not be scared if you know you have not done anything wrong.Do not share your personal information over the phone without verification. Always call the official number that you find online to authenticate the call.

                He added me on Facebook. I briefly looked through his past FB posts and only noticed that he joined FB few years ago but very minimal posts. He kept wanted to move the chat to Whatsapp because he said his job (pilot) can't use FB often. Then we chatted on WhatsApp. 

I noticed 2 things (1) his FB account deactivated after we switched to WhatsApp 
(2) his WhatsApp number is a business account. 

I suspect he was also trying to scam another girl because he 'explained' his FB account got hacked even though I didn't tell/ask Him. He uses a lot of sweet words during chit chat. 

One day he said he bought a lot of branded stuff for me and asked my address to send to me. I tried not to but still have him my address. I felt uncertain and decided to Google for love scam cases and come across this site which shares the scam stories. I saw got girls being asked for few thousand dollars from the fake delivery company. I texted him to tell him that I was expecting a fake delivery company to contact me. His WhatsApp number is deactivate... Through this experience, fortunately I didn't lose any money but I did lose my personal info to scammers.. Sharing my story so that other girls can also look out each other and prevent tragedy from happening.

                Somewhere in Apr, I entered into a movie ticket promotions and then was led into entering a quiz to get free tickets. After the survey was almost done, they prompted me to key in my credit card details. Upon seeing that, i stop the whole quiz and closed the form.

However on the 16th May, i received a quiz certificate sent to my address followed by sms to ask me to settle the payment for this quiz with an invoice. the payment is $59 and there will be late penalty charge every week of $10 if payment is not received.

I did not made any payment and continue to receive the SMS asking for payment! Not intending to make any payment but concern about whether they would harass my home for payment.

I was approached by this taiwanese student called  on a dating app, and he asked me to add him on line (AY832). HE OFFERED MASSAGE SERVICES FOR 100sgd/2hours, and was friendly throughout the conversation. When i went to the meeting place (I.e. Axs at hougang central), he said that he would need me to talk to his friend. Shortly after, his friend () called to say that as this student was on a student pass, it would not be convenient for cash transactions. Hence, i would need to pay rmb500 FOR the massage services via AXS (Alipay), and subsequently another sgd2,500 worth of alipay as deposit for the safety of this student. I demanded for a cheaper price, but he claimed that this was part of HIS hotel AND UNDERGROUND CASH VAULT regulations, and warned me that HE HAS MY PERSONAL DATA AND THAT if i don't pay up, my family and i will land up in trouble. He ALSO TRIED TO calm me down by guaranteeing that I could retrieve all my money upon meeting the masseur, who would make sure that I would enjoy a high level of service. 
After doing so, he continued to ask me to withdraw sgd1,500 (and then sgd2,000) as other forms of security deposit, in the form of apple cards. He claimed that his big boss WOULD NEED MORE assurance from a first-timer. He also deliberately let me overhead his conversation with his bosses in an attempt to have more credibility. Upon doing all these, he then asked me for another SGD$3,000 as security for other forms of financial arrangements before he can refund me the cash through my cash. It was then I suggested to stop ALL CONVERSATIONS WITH HIM AND THE STUDENT, despite threats or persuasions from these people.
THE MASSEUR CONTINUED TO LINE ME thereafter and asked if I could purchase another SGD$150 worth of Apple card. After that, he would meet me to pass the rest of the cash. He continued to say that he has no intention of lying or scamming me, but this is part of hotel regulations which he cannot go against. He said that he had tried his best to mitigate with his big bosses on his behalf - hence the eventual amount of $150.
As I have already resigned to the fact that i could not take back the rest of my money (After contacting the bank and AXS) and that they would demand for more, I rested my case by telling him that I will only do so if I see his face in front of me, and he passed me the rest of the case. He insisted that he would only travel down to see me after I completed the purchase and show him the card via LINE. He has not replied me since i propose such way of meeting.

                I wanted to get a mobile via a loan. And I came across this scammer. He asked for our nric and payslips. Then once approve no contract was given. They just say they would transfer the loan of $1300 money to our account and monthly pay $130. But they transfer the $300 in 2 different transaction and don't inform you. Then balance $1000 I had to chase like mad then I got worried I dont want this loan anymore and when I asked for their acct number to return the $300 they hesitated, but they gave eventually. Once the money was transferred I thought everything was settled and they didn't contact us. 

After a month or so they called from different numbers to threaten and blackmail to say we owe them money and all. Its really stupid of me to Fall into this please never get yourself or anyone into this scam EVER. They will always work at night only. Daytime they won't contact us.

Later, he said my name and nationality. he said my country consulate here in Singapore has issued deportation notice on me. he asked me if i did any crime. later on call got cut and then he again called me and threatened me not to cut call since its ICA call. later he said this call is on recording. after some threats he said i have not entered alien REGISTRATION number in the disembarkation form at the time of entry into Singapore. that very moment i knew its a fake call. i told him its been 6.5 years that i first entered singapore and if my disembarkation form is incorrect then how i got the employment pass. i told him i am hanging up and he said he will get me arrested and soon ICA officer will come my home if i dont talk to him and share more details. i did not care and hung up to call indian consulate and mom to understand genuineness of this call. 

i googled and saw the sample template of singapore disembarkation form and nowhere it asks to enter alien registration number in it. its a clear case of impersonation and scamming people and trying to get more personal information.

I chose 4 hrs and i was told to meet her at clementi mall. I tried to be careful so i kept my credit card and all personnel belonging at home and only brought cash. when i reached clementi mall, i was told by meng qi that a guy will call me to ensure i was no link to police. the guy called me, said to ensure safe transaction, i need to pay the girl through alipay and keep the receipt for the girl, that's how the girl get the pay. i was persuaded and went back home to get the credit card and followed his INSTRUCTIONS to transfer 1000rmb (~$200) to the account [email protected] i message Meng Qi that i finished transferring and the guy called me again, said i need to deposit rmb9000 (one transaction is max to be rmb1000, so need transfer 3 times to ensure my identity. i missed heard what he had said in phone and i deposited only rmb3000. i was so tired because he kept asking for additional fees and he claimed that these money will be refundable. so i did it, and messaged meng qi again. the guy called me, guess what, he asked for medical insurance for the girl to make sure she won't be hurt in the deal (total RMB12000 but this guy 'ah kun' said he helped me to cover half of the fee, so i need to pay rmb6000). i told him i have no more money and he persuade me to borrow form other people. i was quite lost that time as i just wanted my money back, i borrowed $800 from my friend and went for the transaction. thanks god, my credit only could go for one rmb6000 transaction and not enough to go for second transaction. i felt totally hopeless and so called 999 and went to clementi police station to make a report. in the meantime, meng qi (the imaginary girl, who never appeared) sent me video that how people got hurt by them because of cheating them (what? not i'm the one being cheated?). Ah Kun also messaged me he will check THROUGH my contact number and find my working place, hurt my family etc etc.

here i just want to say, money never come back to me, and currently i'm safe. don't hope that money is refundable, i hope that my story is pretty clear for you and don't be the next victim. Thanks!

                Received an SMS on the advertised loans. I asked for more details and scammer requested for personal data such as front and back of my nric, bank account number, cpf Contribution History and 3 next of kin hp numbers. I gave but felt skeptical, and I told the scammer that I need more time to think before Deciding when he told me that he will transfer me $300 and I need to transfer him back $500 and he will return the $200 before loan starts. I did not agree to that and asked for more time to decide. 

The next day, the scammer transferred $300 to my account without my knowledge. I told him I did not agreed to it and I will return to him. He said to return to him to another bank account which he needed more time to get one due to public holiday. A few days later, he gave me a bank account number for me to transfer back the $300. Once transferred, he told me to transfer another $200 which was not part of the agreement. He said in order to not take up the loan, I need to transfer him$200 which will then be transferred to me. I did not comply and emphasised to him that he did not mention anything about transferring $200 for closing of loan. He then threatened me that he will collect it from my office or neighbours. I did not reply to his message and immediately made a police report.

Police recommended me to stop messaging him, change my number and close my bank account. I felt relieved after making the police report and hoping that I will not be threatened in other ways despite them having my personal data. 

I wasn't so interested to get the loan hence I did not make the decision to transfer my own money to him. But this is a lesson learn for everyone to be wary of such scams.

                I GOT to know this lady on Locanto.  Lady agreed that i should pay her $100 for 1 HOUR of sex and massage 

I then proceeded to Sembawang road petrol station and was told by her that she will get a friend to call me to check if i’m a police or whatsnot. 

So this guy by the name of (Ah kun) 
Told me that Due to me being a First timer and all to protect me and the girl from being scam, That Instead of paying cash, i should buy alipay credits from the axs instead. 

As i only had cash with me i told him I couldn’t top up axs due to the needs of using a card for payment and then He persuaded me to find a atm or find a fRiend to TranSfer me first and i can pay back later. 

So after talking awhile and walking around like an idiot to find a deposit machine, I topped up $200 (1000rmb) as agreed, then shortly after he told me to transfer another $1200 as a deposit in case I do something to hurt the girl. I was told that I would get a refund after my session. 

I was already feeling like it’s a scam when i was told to purchase the alIpay credit but still proceeded to topped that $1200 alipay credits. 

Then I told the guy on the phone that i don’t have $1200 and even if i do have it on me I won’t be giving it to them and then he started threatening me that he would find me and my family and beat the shit out of us since I ""played him out"". 

I know that he can’t do anything so I told him that I would be making a police report.

                I met martin via the app coffee meets bagel (CmB). he started by stressing that because we met online, and thus we should proceed slowly and get to know each other better, there are lots of scammers out there. Thought this was really convincing, so an alert to those who are using the dating apps for the first time. this seems to be the new method used by scammers. For the rest of the story, its pretty standard, he sends love messages early in the morning, and then at night, we chat. then he had to go overseas (that was when Ipressed for a face to face meeting). when he is overseas, he had to put up some money in order to clinch some contracts. he uses overseas numbers (one is in UK, and the other is in US), had some nice pictures taken of himself on business class, deliberately let slip that he has a driver in Singapore where he is in project management. calls to him need to be planned, and a few unexpected calls to him, he never manages to answer. 

He has a nice accent over the phone. So please do be careful.

                This scam sounded so elaborate that i don't even know if this is for real, or is a scam. but i thought i share this story quickly to prevent anyone else to get scammed. 

I met this person shan through the dating app coffee meets bagel. He runs an engineering company, is an Australian but claimed to be in Singapore with contracts from Petrobras and Sinopec

He started our conversation slamming scammers, and tell potential scammers not to contact him if one is a scammer. that was certainly very convincing as i had met scammers online before. he started talking for a week or so, then claimed that he had to travel overseas, to an off-shore oil refining location, where internet connectivity is INTERMITTENT. 

Then when he was overseas, he needed to buy some equipment. and actually shared his on-line banking details, so that i could help him purchase his equipment. then the internet bank has a limit on the amount transferred, and that's when he asked for an infusion of funds, into his personal account, to help him pay for this purchase. so i could see that he had a few million dollars in his account.

This scam is so elaborate as ELLSCORPS CAPITAL/ALTEC EQUIPMENTS/INTEGRITY ENERGY SOLUTIONS all have legitimate websites, so upon first checking, they appear to be legit. however, upon doing a second layer of checks, i drew a blank. eg: ellscrops capital claimed to be a subsidiary of citicorp USA, but checks drew nothing. the companies mentioned also have photos/addresses etc. Altec equipments also am based in the US, and their website shows proper addresses, contact numbers etc.
PLEASE ALL BE CAREFUL!

                This IG: Hyun_jun_smith45 start to Follow me ig on 27 April 2019. Then he start to PM me on the very same day. Treating him as an online friend, we start to chat. He introduced himself as MR Hyun , Dob 15 may 1981 , working in London. He Migrates to London when he is small during Korea war with his parents. Parents move back to Korea for good.

To make it short, I will summaries what is my encounter with him.

1) birthday Round the corner will ask for a birthday gift as a blessing to him. I offer to buy him when he comes to Singapore but he will say a lot of the meaning of giving a gift and not to trouble me just want me to buy him US$300 worth of Itunes card. I rejected him as it is too much to give to a person who I never meet. Then he slowly down the amount to USD$100 but i still rejected. Soon, he asked me for favour to help him buy then he will return me back when he come to singapore. Of course, I acted blur and forget about It.
2) plan to come to Singapore to meet me. Due to his work nature , cannot let his company know where is his whereabouts, he wanted me to book his hotel stay and receive his luggage with a large amount of cash inside( USd $34500)on Behalf of him. At first, I rejected the idea, He will use all means to convince you to go along with his idea. Keep giving you the assurance everything will be fine as the courier company he used is safe and trusted. In the end I accept his idea, but stressed that I would not be responsible for what happened to his luggage. In the end he sent his luggage and later sent me the tracking number with the courier company website. After sending he wanted me to contact the courier company to track Where is the luggage..... to make it short the courier want me to pay SgD$2580 for tax clear and overweight as the item is now transit in Indonesia. When i told him about it he kept wanted me to pay on behalf of him. I rejected the idea cos it didn't make sence if the item is transit in another country there is no need to pay clearance tax( Double confirm with my rElative who is in logistics line). In the end he blocked me from his IG when I messaged him that I realised that he's a scammer. 

I hope whoever see this post will be more careful with guys/gals who know online. Always have a clear head especially when the other person started to shower you with nice and positive words very quickly.

                I matched a girl name  on Tinder, and she told me to switch to LINE.
She told me she's working for sexual service at $100 for 2 hours.
when I reached the area she instructed me to, she asked me for my phone number and I gave her.

She told me that her friend will call me to confirm that I had reached.

afterwards, I was contacted by a Chinese guy with unknown caller number and told me that I am a first time customer and is unable to pay by cash.

So I was instructed to move to a nearest axs machine to purchase $100 worth of Alipay purchase card with his given email address.

he told me that as long as the Alipay purchase card receipt is with me, the money will not be received by him (which is a lie).

after doing so, he told me to purchase another $600 Alipay purchase card as a deposit and told me that it will be refunded back after the service is over.

I felt that this is getting too much so I decided to reject him and forfeit that $100. But the man kept persuading me with the reasoning that as long as the Alipay purchase card receipt is with me, the money will not be received by him (which is a lie).

After 30min of persuading and NEGOTIATING, I decided to stop talking to him and ignore him.

suddenly, he became enraged and threatened me that he had my phone number and my name, he was able to track my location and find out where I live and slaughter my whole family.

i immediately hang up his call but he keep calling me, but i rejected all his call. Suddenly, he sennt me threatening message that he would track my whole family down and slaughter my whole family. The girl  also send me threatening photos and videos of dead people being killed by him.

afterwards, i immediately head to the nearest police station and report the whole situation.

As I went back to check with the Alipay purchase card receipt, the Alipay customer service told me that the $100 Alipay purchase card had already been withdrawn and is unable to be refunded.

I downloaded this dating app Coffee meets bagel (CMB) and like one guy called “Edward Calonzon Jiang. We exchanged phone numbers. 
He is staying in UK, we chatted for a month through WhatsApp and developed feelings and relationship and become his fiancée. 
His story to me was he is an orphan as his parents died in a plane crash in Indonesia. His parents were Indonesians. Before they passed away, they owned a property in Indonesia and one in Singapore. He claimed that he wanted to come and meet me but first have to go Indonesia to sell his property there. 
In Indonesia, his property in Jakarta has tax imposed by Government and needed to pay about S$12,000. I was tricked by him to take up loans from banks and licensed moneylenders to help him. I have been transferring money to a close friend of his in Kenya via online transfers or Western Union.
Then he wanted to transfer money to me from his Barclay account to my SG account via online transfer so that I can pay off the loan that I got for him. But since his Barclay account has been inactive for some time, we needed to pay another $13K to have it “serviced” for it to be usable again. 
It has been almost a month plus and when I realised that he is not coming to Singapore, I realised that I have been scammed.  
Now, I am left with a mountain of debts – from banks and moneylenders.

I received a fax from a Keith Oliver stating that I was eligible to receive the death benefit payout of his late client. According to him, his late client had died without a surviving relative. Due to the both of sharing the same last name and nationality, the life insurance policy of $7M+ can be legally paid to me. He also mentioned that if no beneficiary is presented by the end of May 2019, then the policy will be cancelled. This sounded too good to be true!
I was suspicious and found that the firm Peters and Peter LLP is often used by criminals as part of inheritance scams:www.petersandpeters.com/scam-emails! Also, the e-mail provided in the fax https://petersandpetersllp.com isn’t even their real website!
So glad that I verified it myself before I could fall for the scam!

                i found her telegram ID on Tinder and because she was so pretty, decided to message her. A few days later, she suddenly asked if I want to meet and offered her services. and because she was in need of money. Her boss called to ask me some questions, claimed that since this was my first time with her, the payment for the service would be made via Alipay. Request to make $1000RMB (~S$200) and this amount would be reimbursed S$50 when she met me. 

After I made the transfer, he called me again via LINE and told me to pay an additional S$800 as ""protection fees"". I said I didn't have so much, I only could pay S$400. He said to pay, which I did. 

After that he called me and said that his boss said I had to pay the whole amount of S$800. While suspecting something was amiss, I proceeded to pay as well. Then came in another request to pay another $1,200 as ""Assurance Fee"" to ensure that I am not the Police. When I told him that there is no way I am going to pay that amount, he asked me to go borrow money.

                I had responded to a message on an app called letgo (sorta like gumtree or carousell); a buyer was keen to purchase a branded bag i had listed and had told me to contact her via WhatsApp.

The conversation was normal and she was not too fussy about the price nor condition of the bag, but did appear to be rather impatient.  she had claimed that the bag was a gift to her friend's daughter residing in bukit merah and had wanted to pay for the item and arrange for shipping quickly.

Then claiming that she was in Canada at the moment on a business trip and working (i wondered why to her the time difference did not seem to matter), she then opted to pay via a bank transfer for she did not enrol herself for paylah or paynow (still nothing fishy here, just a matter of tech adoption rate). Asked for my name, bank account number, bank name and get this, email address which i thought was a rather strange detail to ask for, for an online bank transfer,  I have dealt with many buyers and none of them had asked for my email address before except those that had involved paypal. 

Spidey senses tingling I politely declined revealing my email address and told her that my bank details should suffice for the transfer. and this was where hell broke loose.

she immediately turned hostile and told me not to tell her what should be done. reprimanded me for delaying the transfer and mailing, wasting her precious time while working and demanded that an email address be given. asked if i could read and that i should listen to her. her friend's daughter had to receive the bag in 2 days time and the bag had to be sent straight  away. 

I called the deal off on the basis that i was not comfortable dealing with her. also advised her to learn some manners. at the same time i told her that i could read and write very well. and ended with a thank you. because class and manners always first.

Beware the ""Canadian"" bag buyer. her name was Aung and she had a badly cropped photo of a hand on a Siamese cat which appeared to have been cropped from a screenshot of a screenshot.

                The DHL scam is back!

Received a call that started off with an automated voice message in Mandarin, informing me that I have a parcel from DHL. I was asked to press '9"" to speak to an operator. 

Hung up the call as I knew it was a scam. 

Call came from this number which might be a spoofed number:  90815655

                Ok so i got to know this girl on Locanto. I contacted her through LINE for more info.


We agreed on $100 for 90mins of her service. She sent me an address ( choa chu kang avenue 4 block 305 ). I then arranged to meet her there that night at 11pm.


I then contacted her after i reached the location. She called me through LINE and told me that she is a student and wont have any work pass or permit and i will have to walk over to the opposite block AXS machine to buy $100 worth of Alipay credits to pay her as she didn't want any cash transactions for the first meeting.


So i did buy RMB$500 and keyed in the email address that she provided ( [email protected] ) . After which she told me that her friend would contact me and i just need to answer some security questions to confirm that i wasn't affiliated with the police.


Then a guy named “” called me and ask me for $800 security deposit and send a photo of my I/C front back to make sure I wasn't affiliated with the Police. He then called me again and asked for another $800 security deposit to make sure i wont harm or nab the girl. I managed to negotiate to $600. Again stupid me, i bought the credits again. He then again told me there was another “hotel deposit” $800 and it is non negotiable. I couldn't believe it but stupid me i did buy the $800 worth Of alipay credits which was RMB$4000.

He called me again and told me he needed another $2000 refundable deposit as their company account can only transfer at least $4000.


I have cleared all my savings and even had to borrow money from friends and family to pay for the deposits. I have no way that i can Buy $2000 worth of alipay credits anymore. I lost my temper with him and he threatened me that if i didnt pay the $2000 refund deposit. He would ask his “brothers” to come to my house and harass my family. He then gave me a deadline to make payments. In the end, I went to file a police report.  

I lost around $2100 to this scam.

I received a message from “SingPost” saying i have win a prize draw and a link was provided to claim the draw. Once inside, you are told to give 1 usd to claim an iphone. 
After giving USD$1 usd using my credit card, i received a monthly SUBSCRIPTION of USD$85 UNKNOWINGLY FOR A GAMING SERVICE. I only realised it 4 months later.
Upon checking with the Merchant, i was told that the SUBSCRIPTION was activated due to a term and condition stated in the link they provided..
I checked the link and indeed the term and condition states that it will charge me a subscription FEE of 85 usd after 3 days if i didn't cancel the SUBSCRIPTION.
I told the merchant that I didn't notice it as it was one of the terms stated in the terms and conditions webpage. The merchant did however refund me 2 months after getting 2 months of subscription, I asked the merchant to refund me the other 2 months of subscription, and if they don’t I will raise a dispute with the bank. However, I only got back one month of subscription. 
I checked with the bank but because I did agree to the terms and conditions, they couldn’t do anything unless the merchant refund me the money. 
Please read the terms and conditions of anything that you sign up for and if an offer sounds too good, then be wary as it may come with a HUGE catch that you are not aware of.

I then opened a trading account via the link https://bitcoi?s-e?a.com (company named F?leader) and deposited usd500. 
Via credit card payment. I received an email saying I have to send a copy of my credit card. This is when I became suspicious and i logged in to withdraw my money. The trading portal did not allow me to do so, and said i needed to complete verification first. So, I spoke to the customer service of F?leader. 
Called IVA Atevens at 31386869 as listed in their site https://www.f?leader.com/contact-us/, and asked her to cancel my transaction and return my money. I also called my credit card bank UOB and asked them to freeze my card and also apply to dishonour the merchant for my payment. They asked me to register a police complaint.

He expressed interests in finding a life-partner and we communicated via WhatsApp. He claimed to be an American-born Chinese staying in the States. His father is a Singaporean, while mother an American. He claimed to be A PHD HOLDER but many spelling errors. He’s a project supervisor in the oil and gas industry. His wife passed away 2 years ago due to an accident. His mother is very ill and he prays for her survival. He’s good in manipulating feelings. He will always portray himself to be very reliable and nice. He proclaimed his love for me and affectionately although we have never met. He called me once and there was a strong accent that wasn’t American. When I requested for his pictures, he made many excuses not to send When he finally did, it was obviously not his own pics. After 2 weeks, he asked me to go into a business with him. It carried on until a month later when he claimed that he bought me many things and would be sending the items to me in Singapore. I rejected the idea at first but after his persistent requests, I relented. He didn’t tell me about the fees involved until I questioned him. He then became very frustrated and accused me of stressing him out. He told me not to worry as the courier company he went to was very reliable and he had used it before. However, the company doesn’t even exist. When I found out the proper procedures, I end off the relationship with him. The courier company he claimed to use is “Demont Courier Service”.

                I got to know a guy named ‘Tag  Brown Chang’ from coffee meets bagel in February 2019. He claimed to be half Singaporean and half Canadian, grew up in Singapore and went on to study engineering at NUS. He claims to have lost both parents and have uncles and aunts residing in Jurong east, hougang, yishun. He owns a company that provides pipeline maintenance services to oil and gas companies such as marathon petroleum Corporation from the USA. He is currently on short-term contract work in Indonesia and typically returns to Singapore almost every quarter to visit his son in Malaysia in Malacca. He claims to be a divorcee, ex-wife is living in Malaysia with the son. What is highly suspicious about him is the immediate confession of love and commitment to a serious relationship within A few days of short texting. I became suspicious and googled for scams under his name and found a scam alert published on 28 Dec 2018 where a John Chang brown was mentioned as a scammer. And also another report in April 2019 wIth the same name tag Brown Chang was mentioned. He supposed to come back to Sg in may 2019 but he said he had trouble with his pipe shipment. 

The same story as on 28 Dec 2018 reported. He asked my help to email to his piping company (Watson automation system) which I did. Then His items not delivered and he said he could not be online due to bad weather and internet problem. He gave me his bank account pin to log in and i saw he had about $283k++ amount in his bank to make payment to the Piping company. But there was error cos the bank located my ip location address not the same as his. So the bank claimed to block his bank acct. In order to reactivate his bank acct, he has to pay $7k which he asked from me. 

This immediately raised alarm bells. I told him No. Glad that I searched for clues before it went too far!

                Identical to scam listed on this forum on 23 April where victim lost phone and $30 courier charge. 

Scammer responded to Gumtree advert for iPhone, saying he needed to deal on WhatsApp. He said he needed to buy a phone urgently for his daughter's birthday the next day, and as he is working offshore he can only do via bank transfer and he would add $50 for me to pay the courier. I gave him my bank details and address. He sent screenshots of the supposed transfer via Bank of America , but I said that I would only send the phone when the money is in my account.

At this point his manner became very hostile and abusive saying he has all my details and he will get me, repeatedly sayingthat I would die soon.

Having looked at the other postings here can see that the same person / syndicate has already made many EFFORTS to scam other people. Below are screenshots from the fake Bank of America transfers, they use different phone numbers, but story always the same that they need to buy urgent gift for daughter or relative and it needs to be sent immediately. 

Please be aware.

So when i watapps the number provided they will ask for ur nric, cpf statement, bank account number, next of kin contact, office number. Saying they will need to verify the details 1st to see the installment plan approve anot. By nite he show u the cash deposit receipt saying that money is for trial loan see u can promptly make payment. So i ended up making 3 time 150 transfer to them to 2 different account weekly. When i saw someone post a, comment on the same carousel page is a scam i msg back the number im not taking up the loan. They started to threaten will call and ask ur famiky pay for u, u will LOST ur job etc. Hence i make a police report.

Pls don fall into these type IPHONE/samsung installment plan. Be sure to verify their genuine business. Or if they say they have licensed do check their licence number on tje official website. Im stupid enough To i Gave them the account number. Shld not do that in fact. Once they credit the cash u will fall into the trap without even signing on any contract or terms and condition.

                I got connected to this via an app for some days.  the day we finally planned to meet up, he urgently needed to catch his flight back to United States due to emergency call back for his promotion interview.


2 days later, he contacted me saying he successfully got promoted, and he wanted to share his happiness with me by sending some gifts.  he wanted to know my size for clothing and shoes.  an I gave him the information.


next day, he told he bought some clothes, and he wanted to send them to my home address.  and I gave him the information yet again. 

next day, he mentioned he has arranged a parcel shipment with express delivery.  he mentioned it would cost some money for the deliveries, and he inserted USD$1,800 to refund the custom clearance.  I was online on live, so i immediately replied don't send it if he had arranged for such a big parcel to be sent to me.

A few days later, a guy, express delivery service contacted through whatsapp informing me that the parcel contained high value item and put on-hold for custom clearance. It cost S$3,500 to clear the customs.  I asked for the shipping invoice and delivery note to understand what item it contained, however the delivery guy said no access such documents as the parcel has been hold at customs.


I immediately contacted the shipper (the guy contacted through online), to understand the details of parcel, and he mentioned some apple devices, clothes, shoes, watches and necklaces.  I asked why this online friend how come he sent such high valued item to me since we have not met each other at all, then he said he liked me. 
 
Both the shipper and delivery guy kept pushing me to proceed the payment to avoid further delay of delivery.  And both of them said there was no way to reject the parcel receipt.  again i asked the shipper why he pushed me so strongly to receive the parcel as I don't really understand the importance of the delivery made on the same day or next day.


Anyway, I trusted them and arranged a bank transfer of sgd3,500 to the bank account which they said finance team for them.  the bank details  i transferred the money to:

bank : posb

account : 056-45084-?
account holder : ng hwe? chen?

*** prior to bank transfer, i contacted posb (1-800 111 111) to confirm if this bank account is related to scam, however the telephone operator says they cannot share personal information ***


alternatively, the delivery guy gave another bank account for the payment


bank : uob

account : 457383548?
account holder : ng puay khin?

afterwards, the delivery guy asked additional fee of payment of S$15,500. By this time, I felt that something was really not right and told both (the shipper and the delivery guy) that I would report this case to the police.

                I wanted to get a loan. Received an SMS, thinking that they are licensed money lender and the interest rates they offer are lower than the local banks.

Prior to loan disbursement, he asked for a ""payment review"". How they do that is by transferring me $600 first then 7 days later, they need me to repay them $1000 and the extra $400 will be deducted from the 1st month loan repayment. I was surprise of the suddenly transfer of $600. I asked for their account number to refund back but I was told I need to pay $1000 instead. I told him I don't need the loan, he threatened that I will still need to continue paying the payment review to clear my name and close my file. He continue to send me voice message to threaten me daily and also send me my house photo which he took from goggle map. He didn't sound local and he even challenged me to report to the police, which I did for safety reasons. And I didn't take up the loan offer. 

Don't respond to any of SMS-, WhatsApp- messages offering loans as they are illegal!

He said he is staying in the US and his father is a Singaporean and mother is American, he visited Singapore in February and loved Singapore very much. And he made up his mind to relocate to Singapore if he found his love. He is a petroleum engineer and rewarded a project in Turkey that worth a lot of money. After this project, he would have enough capital to settle down in Singapore and invest in some business in Art.


He called almost everyday according to the  US and Turkey timing ( very convincing), and sent his pictures consistently, but once I asked for Facetime, he would reject it and gave many excuses to not doing it.


After 3 weeks, he said he had some problems with the project and asked for huge amount of money. And he gave his agent's account and appeared to be a DBS Multiplier account. Few days later, he asked to access his company account to transfer money to mine. he also gave me a fake American passport. it was badly photoshopped.

He asked for payment to ensure the safety of the girl and made sure the girl wouldn't think that the company TOOK the money instead of giving IT to her. So he asked me to pay via Alipay to [email protected] So based on the amount, it was to be 500 X2 RMB so that conversion would be to 200 bucks Sing dollars. Thereafter, he said there was another payment to be made, and I was getting suspicious, but I still paid another 40 BUCKS using the same method. And he asked for another one again using another reason, AND I was already out of cash. That's when he asked me to buy iTunes cards and said it wasn't linked to his COmpany in HK compared to the Alipay payments. I have already CHEATEd 250 bucks by then, and I didn't want to pay MORE without seeing  first. She asked for the 16 numbers of it to VERIfy before she came down to fetch me, but when I asked her to tell me how many lifts there were at the block, she couldn't answer and feign ignorance and that's when I knew it was a scam and came to this page when I googled.

As i don't know how to use bitcoin atm, I told her to give me a direct account number and i transfer her back the money. and she did. after a few weeks, my bank account has been freezed by the authority. i went to make a report and they say i am being investigated. The worst time of my life, salary would be FREEZED as no withdrawal are allowed to be made by my account.  i have 4 kids to feed. And if after investigation and they think im not in the wrong, my account will only be refreeze in 2-3 months time. 😭😭😭MY only fault is to have the thinking that i could work extra job to earn extra money. please be careful everyone. my case is still under investigation. please don't trust easily.

                Online friend messaged me on april 2019. He claimed that he is Korean and had seen my number on Paktor app. Hence, he is messaging me. He introduced himself as eunjin (+82 7045157073). He is easy to talk with and never fails to message every day. He is always so understanding, comforting, assuring and supportive. It was easy to fall in love with him. He says that the business in the oil sector is bad and he will be going to brunei soon to do a big investment. He says he works for park Choung oil and gas of which he has partner under gs Caltex gas station eunma. He told his mum and sister that he has a girlfriend and his sister wants to meet me. Sister by the name of Veronica claims to be studying medical school in Germany. He flew off to Brunei as planned to start business talks with oil partners to purchase 31000 barrels of oil at $62/ barrel. He said that it is a reasonable price and it is cheaper than Middle East. The total investment is about 2 million dollars. Two days later, he feedback that he is very stressed as government tax is involved and he could not raise the amount required. Amount required was usd$12000. I told him he will have to think of means himself as i do not lend money, especially to a guy that I have never met or video called before in my life. He began to be defensive and used a lot of reverse psychology methods to make you feel guilty. I requested him to produce his identification card, boarding pass from Korea to Brunei, flight reference number from Brunei to Singapore and hotel booking reference number. Unfortunately, he couldn’t give. For boarding pass from Korea to Brunei, he says that he has thrown it away. The passport was confiscated till he made the payment so he couldn’t send me that. As for flight reference number, he couldn’t access his email to find it but kept reiterating that he will fly to Singapore on 26/4/2019. I contacted the hotel name which he gave and was told that no such reservation could be found. Amount was lowered to usd$7000 the next day, but I showed him that my bank account only has 1900 sgd. Today, 26/4/2019, he says that he needs usd$1700. I again told him to send me proof of identification. He says I am stingy and selfish to leave him in the lurch and he is going to suffer from depression because of funds. Many times, he says that because he is shy, he doesn’t dare to ask funds from his business partners and friends, but in my opinion, when you are desperate, you ask everyone, not someone that you have met for 17 days only.

I wish to bring to attention questionable contact and sales tactics by two companies, Asi? Claim and Paremount Strategie?.

My mum, a victim of the Geneva gold scam, was contacted by a certain Susan (+65 8374 695?) who claimed to be calling from Asi? claim. Susan said that Asi? Claim is a litigation company and is helping victims of the Geneva gold scam to recover their monies through a civil class action lawsuit. Susan received my mum's number through someone who was also a victim of the geneva gold scam, and who had given Susan my mum's number when she made a claim assessment report with Asi? Claim.

I accompanied my mum to the Paremount Strategie? office on 23 april 2019 to make a claim assessment report. While waiting to hear back on whether my mum was eligible to be part of the lawsuit, we were offered one share in Wyndham Sundancer resort Lombok which guaranteed usd34,000 in 5 years, in exchange for 3 pieces of the gold she had on hand which was bought from Geneva gold. We were not informed at any point prior to the appointment that we would be subjected to such a pitch during the session.

Questionable aspects:
(1) Susan contacted my mum several times to persuade her to take up the case. When i spoke to Susan, she insisted that i could not accompany my mum when she was being interviewed for the claim assessment, even though she did not understand English.
 (2) The people we met at Paremount strategie? (the supposed sponsor company which is doing the 'interview' for the claim assessment on behalf of Asi? Claim as they do not have an office in Singapore), a certain Miko Tse and a guy called Sean (or similar) with a strong British accent, kept us in the room and said we have to listen to the gold-for-share proposal (see s/n 1). They prevented us from leaving the room, took turns to explain the proposal, and claimed that the lawyer's reply had not come in several times I asked.
 (3) the day before, a person supposedly from the law firm and speaking with a strong British accent calling from a Malaysian number (+60 18-221 731?) called to inform my mum about the appointment. I took the call since my mum could not speak English. On the morning of the appointment, my mum received an SMS reminder. I called the number from which the SMS was sent (+65 8599 270?) and spoke to a certain Rosie. This was when i found out that the 'sponsoring' company is Paramount Strategie?. I found it suspicious that when i spoke to Sean (or similar) at the office, he seemed to know that the 'lawyer' called the day before to confirm the appointment; I suspect they could be the same person.

According to Miko, there are people who have taken up their proposals. I hope to bring this to your attention IN CASE THIS TURNS OUT TO BE SCAM AND MORE CONSUMERS FALL FOR IT.

We made a deal and he has asked me to give deposit amounting to $400 SGD, to stay for 2 nights from Dec 15-17 in MBS. ON dec 12, he messaged me via whatsapp and carousell, that he had work emergency and he had to leave Singapore for a couple of months as he was asked to fly to us and he will be back after CNY. I asked him if he has other means to make the refund, but he said he does not have as he was not Singaporean. I asked for a picture of his IC, or passport. He sent me a passport picture.  

I messaged him again via whatsapp however is already unable to receive my messages.

                Buyer contacted me thru whatsapp for a samsung galaxy s10+ that i was selling on gumtree for sgd 1000.00 on the 15th april 2019. He wanted to buy this for his daughter's birthday the following day, so wanted the delivery man to pick up the phone on the same day. he sent over a screenshot which showed the transfer of SGD1040.00 (inclusive of delivery man fees of SGD 40.00) from bank of america to my dbs account - all seems well and it usually takes 2 to 3 days for interbank transfer to show in the statement. The collection was made on the same day and i paid SGD32.15 to the delivery man. 

I followed up with the buyer over whatsapp everyday to check with his bank on the payment delay - unfortunately he has decided to block me on whatsapp today 23/4/2019 and i have no way of contacting him now. i have lost the phone and the payment to the delivery man. 

Other identifying details of this buyer is that he claims to be an engineer working on an offshore platform.

                I got in touch with a DDaeng on Carousell to get a last minute staycation as it wasn't available on official site. I was looking to take over someone else's booking. This seller is a verified seller with a 5-star review and thus I thought it was safe. She got a WhatsApp number from a Jessica to msg me and we dealt accordingly - with me transferring 220 over to another PayNow number (Janie). A confirmation was sent and i emailed the hotel to confirm the booking (they took 1 day to reply). The next day, on check-in day, Jessica WhatsApp-ed me to inform that due to a system glitch, my booking was not captured and the hotel would compensate me with a 2-night stay instead if i would agree to change the date. I refused and asked for refund which Jessica said would take 5-7 working days to process. By then, hotel got back and said my booking does not exist at all. I questioned Jessica and she replied ""booking is under 3rd party system that's why hotel couldn't check"" and to wait for my refund. Of course refund didn't come till now and i got scammed.

The carousell seller told me she was a student earning commission from this. And after we got scammed, she broke all dealings with scammer and she washed her hands off.  Although i only bought due to her verified/good reviews status, she just step out of the situation. Not even sure if she's real.

Just be cautious when dealing on Carousell.

                Got into contact with the Moneylender called Ivan from fast credit pte Ltd. Wanted to take a $10k loan over a period of 3 years.

Gave him picture of my ic front and back along with my CPF statement. Was told to do a trial payment before loan can be approve. Ivan transferred me $700 for $1000 loan repayment within a week. Before week is up, I ask him I want to pay, he ask me to transfer $300 only. Once done, he ask me to transfer another $1000. But I transfer thru Ibanking. Was told that money is stuck and need to pay another $1000 thru atm which I did. After that still need to pay another $3.2k to activate my account. But I did a late Payment and have a pay penalty of $1.8k by then I was already threatening them that I will call the police cause too much money given. Ivan promised that the $1.8k was last and after that I will get my money on top of whatever I have given them. Once I given the $1.8k, he called me to say I need to pay govt tax of $1.7k. I give up afterwards. Paid too much but not a single cent received. Told Ivan I got no more money to give and next day went to the police.

Police told me to block the number and do not contact them. They started to harrased me with different numbers and threathing to burn down my house. Threatened my parents also by calling their mobile number and my house number. 

Not worth the trouble all to go to this moneylenders. Made me think who is the moneylenders now, me or them.

Almost 2 weeks into knowing him, he told me he  bought stuff for me from Dubai since he's there before flying off to Germany. Received a receipt from him but its does't look credible since there were traces of white spaces erased and replaced with details. I received an email shortly and said i had to pay for handling fees since he already paid $2500 for shipping the items. It was $835 and i had to pay immediately for the items to be shipped out from dubai to singapore. It will be transitting from malaysia tgerefore i had to pay that amount to a woman. I emailed back asking why should it be paid to a woman instead of a company. I looked up the website on the email and it came up to an online horse betting platform. I googled his number and i saw information about bitcoin. I immediately realised it was a scam so i did not make any payments at all. I will make a police report soon.

After a couple of days, I got a call and mail from courier service named Transnet ([email protected]/[email protected]/+60 3-9212-1454/+60 11-5314-9498)  stating I need to pay 3200 dollars to them to get the package and I transferred through online banking to the specified account and after a couple of days got the call again from them stating 3200 is USD and not SGD and asked me to send 1200 SGD more so that they will deliver the package and I transferred them to the specified account.

Again after a couple of days got a call again saying I needed to produce money laundry insurance certificate since there is some cash in that package. I paid 7500 dollars to the courier service to get the certificate by depositing the amount and they are demanding another 15000 dollars. I checked with Singapore customs about the certificate and they told there is no such certificate and asked me to lodge a police complaint. then I realised this was scam and I lost so much amount in this.

I lodged a police complaint in January since I lost 11900 dollars in total and now also I am getting calls every week from the scammer to send money to me.

He says he is flying to Dubai to get building materials for his project and he need financial support as he mortgage his own current house to tide him through this project.

I've made a total of 3 transfers amounting to SGD26,866. Eventually, project payment got screwed and I used up my money and he says that there is still outstanding payment to the building material company as they have sent extra material so that it does not delay his project because It was new material that he purchases and not quite sure it fits.

The worrying thing is that she is from india, she refuses to allow pick up for the ipad pro, and says that she is selling a 10.5 "" ipad pro at $500, buy 3 get 1 free. the testimonials she sent after was of people smiling with phones, and whatsapp chats, with dodgy whatsapp wallpapers of phones. i have reason to believe this is a scam. 

Always check the background of the sellers before trading with them. While checking reviews is an important step to take, they can be faked. For expensive items, and if the seller is local, request to pay after receiving the item.

I was nearly scam on coffee meet bagel. Be careful of overseas people on dating website from stolen profile from instagram or facebook. always video chat them to know. Don’t believe excuses such as  the phone is smashed or the wifi is not good .never give money to them 
1) Do a reverse image search on the photos provided. 
2) never send money to western union or moneygram in any emergency.          
3)never believe in sob story like parents died ,child sick ,stuck in airport, taxation ,accidents, robbed
Always consult with family members or close friends to advice as sometimes you will be caught up with emotions, and not being clear headed. Scammers may work in a syndicate and are experienced con artists. 
The scammer stole pictures from a urologist in Malaysia and I have inform him that his photos have been stolen. 
I’ve informed the person whose pictures were stolen to warn him. 
 I have blocked the person and anyway is all fake accounts and email : Frank Cheng

MY uncle got a spam text message from SingTel Mobile number +441548312048 asking him to key in his personal contact details within 1 hour to win a Samsung phone for $2.50. He submitted his personal details and he got suspicious when the website asked for his credit card details next. He asked for my opinion and I found that the mobile number is from England and the website isn’t related to SingTel at all. My uncle was nearly cheated because he trusted that SingTel has such reward system. 
I hope everyone is aware of these scam messages and hope that seniors would not fall for it.

                A guy from LinkedIn befriended me and later asked to move to Whatsapp. He was nice and very gentle where more likely girls might fall for. He’s working in Marathon Petroleum Corporation in Texas but relocated in Turkey Black Sea in an Oil Rig for 3 months. He mentioned he cannot use video call and calls due to company’s rules and regulations. As an alternative, He used to send more pictures. So for a month chatting, being friendly and really caring, and there’s no trace of anything that was suspicious because there’s no money involved so I continued to play along. He profess his love with more passion and promise to call and visit me once his off from the rig. But when the time his ending his last month from the rig. He mentioned about a new contract that he won for him to extend for another month to handle the Project.  Having this contract will boost his credentials and additional income. After he told me this I’m a bit suspicious because he never mentioned such things in earlier stage. So I try not to bother much about him anymore. But he still persistent in his timing to care for my being. Then one day, he sounds serious and told me that he’s facing difficulty in the project that he’s handling. In short he tried to ask for financial support and that’s when everything turned into disappointment. It’s such a waste of time.

I feel really bad for that guy photos used for this type of scam (It was a Korean and really good looking.)

The details and story used by this scammer wERE already reported here last November 2018 with the same username.               
Luckily I did found this website to support my suspicion.

So ladies, please be careful!

                Met a lady called, Adrian, on coffee meets bagel(CMB) dating app on 2Mar2019.
She said she is a S'porean, based in USA, lost parents and a medical consultant running her own business.

After 1 month of chatting, she said she'll be coming to sg, but will fly to shanghai for biz before coming to SG

Just the day before her trip on Sun(7Sun, New York time), she said she was in pain and cannot move from bed and needed her dr, whom she called. eventually she made the trip and now in shanghai.

This is when she text to ask for monies to pay her Dr in USA to get some special drug sent to shanghai. she gave her personal bank account online logon to try to trick me in showing she is a millionaire as proof of her ability to transfer monies back to her.
alarm bells was raised few times as she did not accept video chats.
I'd reported her ID to CMB, now I'm reporting it here.

No monies were lost as I was lucky to be wary.

Jerry befriended me on facebook and started chatting on facebook messenger. After which he said that he is seldom online so wanted to move to whatsapp. I am used to travelling around so i do have a lot of overseas friends. So we did. He declared his love after chatting for about a month. He said that his dad had passed away and his mum lives in the uk with her sister. He is living alone in usa and was brought up by his uncle. His ex girlfriend had cheated on him. Since then, he has been alone for 2 years. He said he is going to come Singapore for a visit on his birthday, 26 April. Next thing that happened was that he suddenly had a contract that he is vying for. Out of 21 applicants, they are going to choose 7. Then he was going to fly to New York to win the pitch. So about 6 hours later, he said that he had won the pitch and wanted to send me presents that he had bought. Initially i believed, because i do receive gifts from my overseas friends at times (people whom i know in real life) so i gave my address. After that the conversation became strange with him asking me to check the courier company's website every day. Then i found out the courier fee was sgd3000. No way the courier fee is $3000. That was when i got suspicious. I started asking questions and requested for a video call to see him. I was told he cannot use camera and video function on his phone because he is in the management role which i know was not true as he had sent lots of selfie over and including one screenshot which was obviously from a screenshot of video of himself (poor guy whose photo is stolen from). He then called and the accent was totally not an american born chinese (abc). I played along for a while to get the courier company's details. On the day that the courier company asked for money, was the day his facebook profile was deleted. That was when i enlisted the help of my sister to photoshop the page of the courier company and sent him back to say that the parcel is on the way back to usa and he had to pay usd to retrieve his parcel. After that, i blocked him and when i checked on the courier company's website, the order number became invalid. Luckily, no money was lost and we got to troll him back.

I know this guy thru dating app call Paktor. He msged me via the app and requested me to go offline so that we can concentrate developing our relationship. So since early march we have been watsapping each other. And he was a very loving guy and show you much care and will watsapp you promptly everyday without fail. So my feelings for him has grown deeper each day. Till 2 days ago he requested me to help him send one email requesting Ziraat Bankasi to release funds for his offshore project in turkey. He say his reception offshore is very bad and cannot send out email. At that point of time i was already suspecting, so I do a check on the email address given by him and found something fishy. But still I send out the email for him. After that he suddenly say told me that after he check he say in order for the bank to transfer funds he need to open a deposit account and need to out some money inside and request me to help him deposit 15K. I told him I don't have that much money as I know there's something wrong already. So he requested me to put 5K instead.  So I received an email from the so called ziraat bankasi asking me  to deposit USD 5k into one account number. So I whatsapp him saying that I thought it was Sgd 5K,  if it's USD 5K I can't help him. So he again asked me to write to the bank and asked the bank to revise the amount to Usd 3K instead which is equivalent to usd 5K. Surprisingly the so called bank reply was very fast and reply within 5 mins. So I found this totally wrong. After thinking I decide to wastapp him n tell him that all these is a scam and I will not help him with this deposit. So he started texting me saying what's wrong with me?  What's wrong to all the things we plan etc. I just ignored him. Till this morning he still try to coax me into this deposit thing. 

Please be careful and don't fall prey to such scam!

                This is regarding my FDW that works for us Ms Charlene Entredicho. The company Asia telecom called her up in August 2018 and offered to her to participate in a promotion that she can win all kind of THINGS if she tops up 900 peso to a prepaid wallet in PHILIPPINES. After she agreed she got a bill of 60 SGD which is almost 3 times more than the value she got in Peso. 

Later the company continued to call her and send her frequent text messages and whatsapp telling her to pay the outstanding bill and also telling her that she needs to topup more in order to participate in the promotion. 

Overall they sold her ~1600 peso worth 41. SGD and charged her more than 120 SGD. 

After I heard the story I called up the company to try to sort this out but they were not willing to do any settelment and request that she pays all the remaining balance.

this company is using the helpless and innocent helpers promising them promotions and not enclosing the very high costs of the topups and then they continue to HARASS  and get more and more money.

Contacted the seller and was advised if payment was made today it could be delivered in 2 hours. I asked for it to be c.O.D but seller was insistent that to get the deal it needed to be bank transfer. Transfer made $998.00, deal done... delivery on its way. However, 10 mins before it was supposed to arrive I was told my item was held up at customs and needed to pay extra $480.00 for it to be released and I would receive the $480 in cash on delivery.

He claims to have lost both parents and have a sister residing in New Zealand. His NZ hometown is in Dunedin. He owns a company that provides pipeline maintenance services to oil and gas companies such as petroleum group from the USA. He is currently on short-term contract work in Indonesia and typically returns to Singapore almost every quarter to visit his son in Malaysia. He claims to be a divorcee, ex-wife is living in Malaysia with the son. What is highly suspicious about him is the immediate confession of love and commitment to a serious relationship within two days of short texting. I became suspicious and googled for scams under his name and found a scam alert published on 28 Dec 2018 where a John Chang brown was mentioned as a scammer. This immediately raised alarm bells.

                It is 9.30pm and a man bearing a file with two letters comes and ring the door bell, he says he is a ex convict and was sent by the Singapore police force parole division authorized by the Singapore charity board, all letter look like photocopy of print outs, he say the Singapore parole officers were sending these ex convicts to sell mobile phone accessories to the public so as to support their livelihood, and that these was authorized by the Singapore charity foundation and Singapore police force. when I asked him further question, he refused to answer and became very pushy and started to swear in hokkien like the local  gangsters around our estate. He then quickly put his mobile phone accessory into his pocket and left.

I was amazed that the Singapore police force parole division was starting such a scheme , as a person who has hired ex convicts before, I know that the police parole officers would try to arrange full time jobs for these ex convicts so that they may turn a new leaf in life. But what I found weird is that the Singapore police would send out these ex convicts to seek donations. 

Please verify  all requests before donating!

he proclaimed he was still stuck in Brunei for MANY MONTHS due to his passport being retained by Shell to pay over this amount of balance SGD2000 shipping fee. I GET TO sAW his real person on the video. I have decided to help him to pay up the balance of SGD2000 through online OCBC TT of SGD680 and another set of transfer through Western Union of SGD1323 which was remitted to him successfully through his 2 friends Malaysian bank accounts.

he claimed he was charged another SGD8000 for the government and company taxes fees of the late charges and he was still permitted to leave the country, I have contacted the hotel in Brunei before there is no such check-in person name and valid room number.

he scammed another SGD3100 from me saying that he have to pay the interest fee charged for over-staying in Brunei and another MSIA Airline tax for keep changing his flight itinerary. And this time round, he asked for another SGD900 to pay for the hotel room fees for not paying for the hotel. after afew month he claimed he still stuck in Brunei. 

I attempted to chase back my money SGD5,100 and he still asked me to lend him and threatened not returning back to me all my money if he couldn't raise another SGD900 to pay for the hotel room fee charges and even used so-called his mother to pressure me for money help through wassapp messaging. I even threatened to report to KL police and he asked me to report faster, this time I wouldn't barged to help him and he scolded me and blocked me on wassapp.

                I just received a call from someone claiming to be a senior immigration officer in Singapore.

The person said, I don't have updated my ""alien registration number"" while coming to Singapore and it's a crime to continue working like that. They are sending cops to my home in 30 mins and have to deport me and my wife today. I can also avoid this by purchasing an apple itunes card worth SGD 4000 for them from nearby 7-11 or fair price shop.

I checked with MY company, our immigration consultant and Indian embassy in Singapore, it turns out to be a fake/spam call as there's nothing called as alien registration number.

This person had called my wife first and then called me. He threatened us for custody and SENDING cops to home to arrest. overall it was a scary experience. 

Unfortunately, I have provided my passport number, ep number, singapore address and India address.

                A guy name peter (ig @chungp?) followed me on instagram and dm-ed me. he started with introducing himself and said that he added me because he thinks that i'm pretty. we chatted, and then exchanged contact number. after that, we started chatting on whatsapp. so, he told me that he is a civil engineer working for zion oil and gas. also, he claims that he is from china but residing in usa california. 

He would greet me in the morning with a ""good morning"" text everyday without fail and would send a ""good night and sweet dream"" text when i was going to sleep. he does all the sweet talking with all the love emojis until one day he told me that he is working on an offshore contract and wanted me to pray for him. it then followed by him saying that he went shopping that day and also did some shopping for me and was going to mail it to me. he proceeded to send pictures of the items he bought which includes a Chanel bag with a brown envelope that contained usd$19.8k, jewelry, LV flats, iphone 7 and iphone 8. i was overwhelmed. i told him that i don't want any of these and he begged me to just receive it for this time and he would not do it again.

I was angry so i did not reply him and then he whatsapp call me. I picked up but it was a guy with a strong Indian accent. i straight away knew it was a scam. i hung up the phone and blocked him immediately in all the social media. i went back to check our conversation he had deleted all the pictures of gifts and the text messages. he was probably afraid that i would screenshot and report him.

                We met on Facebook and we didn't talk much at the beginning. We exchanged phone numbers for WhatsApp later. Got to know each other better. Nothing seems out of the normal, but after a month later, he sent a parcel over saying it contains gift for me. 

Received a text after a few days stating, I had to pay customs tax of $2,000 to a personal Citibank account. Sadly for him,  I spotted the scam and didn't pay a cent as i know this isn't the proper way of paying taxes for incoming parcel to Singapore.

In the text ,they say they are legal and provide a website that look real. So I gave them my details and photo of the ic to CHECK. Then they say since it was my first time taking a loan from them, they could only loan me a small amount. 

But when time come to repay and I ask for account but they just said they not have a bank account. They wanted me to pay for defer payment .and I did so and I keep going for some time and then I received another text that I owe the money and wanted me to pay up if not they would come to home and find trouble and they have call my home and took photo of my HOME.

                He added me as a friend in facebook and I accept it. He told me he stay and work in Sydney but holding a Hong kong passport. His father is from hong kong and mother is from singapore. His mother and sister had already passed away due to a car accident. he said he is not married but have a son. 

We actually have common interests, He kept saying he loved me and wanted to spend the rest of his life with me. He always claimed that he is the boss (business man) and his dad also businessman. Photo shown that he is a handsome and rich guy.


Then one day, he sent me a photo of 9 boxes of bearing the Lanvin brand and told me that he wanted to send the gifts to me. He said he bought all these for me. When I asked him what is inside the boxes and he refused to disclose. Kept saying that I would know when I receive the parcel. After that he got his manager to arrange out the parcel he sent me the tracking link and tracking number, I got more shocked than surprise. the AWB stated amount charges S$3500. I told him I'm not going to pay for the local charges because I don't have the amount. Best thing is that the parcel is at Malaysia instead of Singapore. I ask the courier company why, he say they don't have a office based in Singapore. There office is based in Malaysia. so I asked them to provide me the declaration for the goods and the invoice for the S$3,500 charge. They said cannot, I will only get those documents after I paid. So I told them fine, please return back the parcel to the sender. Next moment sender called me to find out what is the problem with me for accepting the parcel which he send out. I told him straight away, I got no money to pay for the local charges. Now, he kept silent on me.

                i made a payment of $700 to secure a dyson airwrap sold on carousell that was sold out islandwide. It was a pre-order and i had to wait 2 weeks. Lister was very responsive to receive money but once payment is made, replies were slow and item eventually never received. apparently the lister is merely an advertiser and not the one who deals with the stock directly. there is a stocktaker and a supplier as well. 

Long story short, i never got my item and my promised refund never came. it has since been 8 weeks and counting

After the payment mike told me that new regulation, have to take one more time trial loan of the same amount which i stupidly do so. Atlas, no loan amount was approved but they proceed to credit $700 to me without me asking for it or agreed this time. I sense something was wrong and made a police report.

                I just lost $100 to a carousell seller. His account name is benjamintan99 and to date nicholas245. He is selling USS tickets for 50$ each. He said he won 3 etickets and he is selling as he wont visit universal studios.  He is very engaging...Explaining that he wont be able to meet up as he is very busy at work. when i questioned him about the authenticity of the tickets he was  so confident. he advised that he is willing to refund in case it wont work at USS or even better report him to the bank that if i feel he is a scammer. I've never had a bad experience with Carousell and so I fell into the trap. Once he received the money, he started giving excuses (Eg very busy at work, will send during his break) and then he ignored all my messages. I then found out that he is a scammer when people left messages in his listing following up on their tickets as well. He was only selling 3 tickets  but we were 5-6 people following up! 

He is still online everyday in carousell. he just keeps changing his account name or opens a new account. What a shame!

I first refused and said i only trade locally then he provided a Singapore shipping address. (look like a hdb address). He them asked for my paypal account email and i sent him my direct paypal.me link. He did not use my link and insisted i give him the email address for the account. I gave accordingly. He then said he transferred the money and asked me to ship ASAP. I logged into my paypal and see no transaction then i double checked the email and found it was by PayPal Intl but sent by [email protected] I then verified with paypal and then agreed that this is a scam.

before i started trading i couldnt find out anything about this scam. but in december 2018 and up to feb 2019, many similar stories started to emerge online, all concerning this company and they way they operate


1) befriend you via wechat

2) introduce Btcusd trading

3) help u set up demo account that is profitable

4) when u open a real account, it will initially be profitable

5) then they recommend a bad trade and all your capital is wiped out

6) if you have stop loss and have been making money, they will shut down your account and u cannot get your money

Tan Ng approached me on Facebook and ask if he can have my whatsaap number. I gave him my whatsaap number and we communicated thru whatsapp. He told me he was working as a pilot for a commercial aircraft and he lived in taxas city.
He sent me a few photos of him. Yesterday, he said that he would be sending me a parcel containing iphone, jewellery and handbags to me. He also said he would be including usd$16,000 in the envelope placed in the same parcel. He said I could use it for myself and my kids. Part of the money, to pay for the clearance and delivery charges at the custom to clear the parcel. I was very confused, usd16000 is a lot to pay for clearance and told him that i don't think it costs that much. I don't need so much money for myself too. He then told me he is coming to singapore in june and we could spent the money together. I WAS VERY CONFUSED THINKING WHY would he trust me so much to send me these expensive present.
Today, someone who claimed to be the clearing AGENT NAMED ALEX, ASKED ME THRU WHATSAPP to transfer $2,450 to a POSB account for clearance and delivery charges for the parcel. I told the agent that I don’t have the money and requested the parcel to be returned to the sender. Tan Ng contacted me 5 minutes later tell me to “help” him as usd16,000 was in the parcel. I just ignored his text and went into facebook to check the earlier messenger i had with him and to my surprise, tan's facebook account became invalid. Immediately i know it was a scam. I whatsaap him and tell him that he had played the game well but fortunately i do not have that much money in my bank account to transfer to him.

Few days ago i've matched with this girl  in tinder and added in line. First her is an introduction saying she's a student and part time escort with the rate of $100/2 hr. I declined the offer. 
Yesterday she offered her service again but i rejected. When she asked the third time today, i finally accepted. Being careful i've asked if she stays alone, if she has family here to make sure no one is behind her (syndicate). She agree to meet me up at admiralty MRT.
She was nowhere to be seen but wants my mobile number to be secure. She asked me to meet a friend to ensure she's not being fished by a police. Immediately, I fled as I didn’t want someone else to know. She begged me to stay and proceed while I kept receiving calls from unknown number. I answered the call with the china manager explained the procedures and protocol as she was student part time escort under a hotel.
To protect the both parties, payment will be alipay top up from AXS. I purposely left my atm card at home, so he asked for itunes credit ($100) from 711. He emphasised not to drop the call as he will guide me. He then required my ID to ensure I’m not a police but I didn’t have any id with me. He claimed he is one of the  member and they are running casino369.com. They have some system that can identify an enforcer. He asked to get my id from my place 15 mins’ away and arranged her to meet me up at the hotel nearby. I went back and sent my license to him. He quickly asked if I am a cop as there is no employment history for my identity except for basic information. He said I could  make a deposit to secure the meet up. He'll arrange at a nearby AXS  The deposit would be refunded via cash once we meet. He requested for rmb 1000 x 3 (declined as lack of $$) but reduced to rmb 500 ( i bought alipay $104).
He got angry for fooling him as he asked for rmb1000 alipay. I told him I couldn’t afford and willing to forfeit. He insisted that deposit must be paid. He threatened to hunt down my family, use my name for money laundering since he has my licence. He give me till 9pm and reminded me that don't go missing or ignoring his calls. However she had instructed me to gather $1200 as her manager has told her to do. She then continued to beg me as she will be in trouble. Now i'm receiving death threats after stop replying her and answering calls.

                I got to know this lady on Locanto.  Lady agreed that i should pay her $200 for 4 hours of sex and massage


I then proceeded to choa chu kang mrt and was told by her that she will get a friend to call me to check if i’m a police or whatsnot.


So this guy by the name of (Ah kun)

Told me that Due to me being a First timer and all to protect me and the girl from being scam, That Instead of paying cash, i should buy alipay credits from the axs instead.


As i only had cash with me i told him I couldn’t top up axs due to the needs of using a card for payment and then He persuaded me to find a atm or find a fRiend to TranSfer me first and i can pay back later.


So After talking awhile and walking around like an idiot to find a deposit machine, I topped up $200 (1000rmb) as agreed, then shortly after he told me to transfer another $1200 as a deposit in case I do something to hurt the girl. I was told that I would get a refund after my session. 

I was already feeling like it’s a scam when i was told to purchase the alIpay credit but still proceeded to topped that $200 alipay credits. 

Then i told the guy on the phone that i don’t have $1200 and even if i do have it on me I won’t be giving it to them and then he started threatening me that he would find me and my family and beat the shit out of us since I ""played him out"". 

I know that he can’t do anything so I told him that I would be making a police report. 

Warning to all male users out there: Please Do not fall prey to such scam. There are scams out there and do not be threatened by these scammers!

Don’t make the same mistake i did.

                I got a call from +6564385125 number stating as ICA officer today! Somehow he knows my name and my country name from where I came.He said that he wanted to speak to me regarding some urgent matter and Asked me to go to some silence place. He introduced him as an ICA officer and scaring me by telling that i have missed to fill some important information in the immigration point. 

Also he asked me about my original certificates and i said they are at home. then he asked me to go home IMMEDIATELY to get the certificates as some one will come to my home to collect them. he  keep saying me to keep him in CONFERENCE while going to home. I said I don't have permission to go home in office hours. then he said if i don't go now, someone will come and arrest me with in 72 hours. 

He warned me that if I disconnected the call or if i tell to any one that I got call, then it will be a serious offence.EVEN I TRIED TO ASK HIS NAME AND HE SAID THAT ""don't you think this as a prank call and WE DON'T HAVE TIME TO DO AND DON'T MAKE THIS AS AN ANOTHER ISSUE.""

He talked to me about 20 min and suddenly the call got disconnected. when I checked this number, I found it was a fake ICA NUMBER.

LOOKS HE TRIED TO GET MY PERSONNEL INFORMATION/ ORIGINAL CERTIFICATES details. BUT LUCKILY CALL GOT DISCONNECTED AND I DIDN'T SHARE ANY INFO. so people please beware of these kind of scams.

                I advertised room rent in easyroom and gumtree in Jan 2019. the RESPONSE was not good.  i also did not bother on the room rent as i would like to select a suitable tenant. on 1 march 2019, i was received an email from tan mui joo(chen meiru) asking if the room is available. I replied her that the room is available and i enquiried her some questions such as job occupation, holding any work pass in singapore, etc. she sharing with me that she is working as an it consultant in china but she born in singapore and due to nature of work, she rarely have time making calls. she mentioned that she would like to secure the room and request room pictures including address of the room. i have asked some questions such as location of workplace, if she is holding pink nric, etc. i also request to have VIDEO CALL SINCE SHE IS IN CHINA AT THE MOMENT. I ALSO MENTIONED THAT I PREFER FACE TO FACE TALK. 

however, she did not answer my queries but email me her pink nric and telling me that she will be back on 27 march 2019. with this, i have more questions to ask because usually if you are back to home country, you will be staying with parents rather to rent room unless there is reason. she suggested to transfer rental to paypal account as she only using paypal account and have not been using online access for so long. she given the reason that she is unable to transfer money because work late and banking hall is closed after she finished work. she even teach me how to create paypal account if i do not have paypal account. in view of this, i google check her name and realised that she is a scammer.

I would like to take this opportunity to share my experience to everyone who intended to rent out their room or house, must be aware of this type of people.

                Dear friends,


I have to give kudos to staff at Clementi Post Office who refused to accept my request to remit money on someone's behalf.  Their due diligence have saved me from financial and emotion loss.


Here's the story … I have a room to let and advertised online. A person named TMJ responded and expressed interest.  TMJ claimed she is Singaporean (even gave her NRIC front image) and returning from China to Singapore.  Her only condition was for me to open a Paypal account as it was her only mode to remit money.  I suggested other mode of payment but in vain.


Once I had opened a Paypal account, an email from [email protected] alerted that I had funds coming in but had to wait 3-5 working days before actual fund is credited.  The sum was more than what I had asked for because Tenant TMJ wanted me to help her pay her mover's fee as she was away on business trip in India.  To pay her mover, I was asked to remit fund through Western Union Bank.


I mentioned that I will act once funds are credited into my account but Tenant said the mover needs to be paid 'tomorrow'!!!  Cannot wait …


With kind thoughts to help, I agreed.  Once I was at the Clementi Post Office, the staff asked a very important question.  My answer raised suspicions and I was asked to head down to Western Union Bank, near J-cube.


As I was driving towards J-cube, I sensed something was not right.  Stopped my car and gave Paypal Singapore a call.  The answers were shocking!  Paypal confirmed there was no funds credited into my account and no email was sent to me.   Paypal does not required 3-5 working days to credit any account.  Fund transfer is immediate !!!!


What a narrow escape from email scammer !!!

                Know him by the name of Sean Wang from CoffeeMeetsBagel. His instagram is yongwang100..  he mentioned that he migrated with his parents to Sydney at the age of 5 though his family was from.Malaysia. His profile shows he studied Master from University of Technology Sydney, stays in Darlinghurst. A scammer which I believe is with a team. 

His story is that he used to work with a company as an engineer but trying to bid projects in different countries on his own. One of the projects is Malaysia and few weeks after he mentioned this, he got a project in Kedah. He sent me his contract letter with lookalike Msia government letterhead. 2weeks later, he came to Msia n started the project..
He said to work in Msia, he has to pay withholding tax for non resident and asked If i could help and the rest he will ask from his parents..Later on, as I mentioned i did not have enough, bank details of the person He asked to transfer But i didnt. 
Bank name : UOB
Account name : Rugayah Marilyn binti abin
Account number : 1133010365
Swift code: UOVBMYKL
Address : BANGUNAN UOB 10-12 MEDAN PASAR
he changed his way stating that he has USD 100K to transfer but I exposed him because is from a gmail account and fraud email [email protected] . 

This guy is smart and able to ""read"" you quite accurately. He was able to share about his daily life in details. 

1) He has both Sydney and Msia number +60102817698)
2)  He kept changing whatapps profile image including the latest photo of the guy who wore traditional top during CNY (background is with Pig greeting)
3) No result from reverse image search or scam phone number upon checking australia number. Despite this, pls do a reverse image search to check if a profile pix is being used anywhere else. 
5) Always ask to do a video call to check real person even if the person gives different reasons

Suspicious arose as found that Sydney has no midnight flight but he flew at 4am and 3am to Msia.
So beware ladies when you come upon him, I saw him having a new profile in coffeemeetsbagel.

Subsequently i did a reverse image search- he was using IG profile of a famous person in tHailand, so It was me who was careless. Started to guilt trip me but he had more and more loopholes.

I came down there and she told me she can only meet if I transferred $75. After I transferred $75 she asked me to transfer another $150 for the total amount of $200. I was very naive and transfer another $150. When i went down to her void deck that she asked me to, she asked for another $150 for her release fee and told me she would pay back the $150 in cash.

As I  thought Singapore being a safe country it cannot be a scam. the seller by the name dhdhfh asked me to contact through Whatsapp which i initially hesitated but later as Singapore was a safe country went on with it. he initially offered me a offer that if i buy 3 phones i would get 2 more phones for free. but i insisted that one is sufficient and told i will pay through Lazada. but he insisted me in not going through Lazada as he will not get the full amount. i told how can i believe him without any details. he immediately sent me a NRIC of a Singaporean. i thought it was real and even cross checked the number's originality. It was real, so I paid him. he then told me to pay via bitcoin. I grew suspicious about it. but later he sent bank details of posb 09391661?. I sent $250 to his account and sent a screenshot. he told me that he will deliver the product by the next day. but it never happened. the next day i repeatedly messaged him. finally he responded but saying that i have to pay the customs in order to get the phone. he gave the second account number 438-18545-3 posb account. his name is tan boon leng and he sent me an nric card photo s781797?h. my money is gone and hope he would get caught. i would track his ip address to be 197.210.45.191 with location in Nigeria, as he is using a vpn. and i reported to jurong west police with Report Number: J/20190223/2036.

                Guy with mom profile pic befriend and profess love after 3 days of chatting. Seems sincere and constantly checking you out.

Went to the extend of asking your thoughts about him and shared about you to his mom.

Lovely guy who cared so much about you, and showing his devotion to faith with very strong command in english


Said to send a gift and never provided any information on the courier.
I received a text saying to pay import charge of $3580. Person who send the text have no absolute idea on the cost breakdown and they just wanted the money

Did not reply to the message after. Scammer got emo because i did not comply and i got ""emo"" too because he did not want to help sort out the issue

Sent him a text after and thank him for loving me , and told him to stop scamming people.

I had listed an ad on Gumtree to sell a handbag about a month prior to the incident. Suddenly i was contacted by Whatsapp by someone claiming to be a mother needing an urgent last minute birthday present for her daughter. She told me i needed to mail the bag out to her immediately so that she could get it the next day as she would be overseas after. She asked for my postal code to help arrange a courier service for me. She then asked for my bank account number to transfer me the money for the bag and the courier service. I gave the bank number but told her not to send me the money until i confirmed the shipping. She then sent me screenshots of an apparent wire transfer from bank of America. At this point, I had called courier companies and many told me that it was impossible for the bag to arrive on the stipulated time. So, I told her that I would refund her the money and that we should stop the transaction altogether. I checked my bank and no money was received and in the screenshot she sent it said the wire transfer was 'non-refundable', which was strange. She then proceeded to spout vulgarities at me and threatened to ruin my life and that I would ""be dead in 24 hours"". Her story didn’t check out as wire transfers also usually cannot happen over the weekends and she sent me a screenshot of her account balance to ""prove"" that she had paid. I told her she could call the bank since the wire transfer did not go through, and to cancel it, but she still didn't give up.
I went to the Police to report the matter as her behaviour was highly suspicious and I was feeling afraid that I could be targeted.

                I got connected with this guy called Bee Travis from Tinder. After a few days of chatting on Tinder, we moved to WhatsApp as we got comfortable and as we are both mature and he looked clean n sincere. 

Travis claimed to be an American from Huntington and a divorcee and father of 1 son, who's studying in UK. We chatted daily over the phone for about 1.5mths. 

Travis said he's based in Bintulu for project & after would be heading to Singapore. Soon after, he told me he faced problems with his storage equipment n needed to rent a space urgently n the agent there needed him to pay immediately n he asked me for HELP. I don't know why I agreed as I trusted him as we communicated daily!

I transferred $6,600 to his agent name Matthew Tzebeng Ng n he promised to return the loan within days. We continue our normal communication till after 3 days, I asked him about my money n he says the guy went missing n he himself felt cheated n he says he paid 6600 to the office when he was at the shipyard.. I'm so devastated & felt cheated. N best thing he asked me to look for that agent Matthew or go to my bank for help. From there, I know it's a scam n to make it look real he provided me with the agent hp n home address n asked me to get money back. 

I felt ashamed of myself n I didn't dare to share my situation with my friends and get help. After the incident, where our conversation would always be on my loan to him. He became another person and turned cold n he stopped messaging me. I sent him many messages but he didn't reply although he is on WhatsApp. Now, it's been 2months & I knew I was cheated. 

Please be aware of this Bee Travis Rodriguez... I was cheated n he's a scammer.

                I received phone call from Singapore MOM. (Ministry of Manpower). The officer informed me that during my recent entry into Singapore, i wrote my dob (date of birth) wrong on immigration card (instead of mm/dd, i had written in dd/mm) upon verification by the embassy of Singapore in Delhi, it failed. I’ve been told my passport has been “black marked” which means I have to deport Singapore immediately and will no longer be eligible to work in Singapore in my entire life!! A High Court case was raised in Delhi too. I was doomed. I can get out of this if my dob can be re-verified and the case can be closed. But, have to report in Delhi high court by tomorrow to get the verification done and settle the case! He provided me with complete details of whomI should contact in Delhi and about the incident with reference numbers. So, I will have to leave tomorrow morning!

He also informed if the verification in Delhi is successful, I have to meet an embassy officer in MOM, to verify my dob certificate, passport, employment pass again here in Singapore. The officer will provide me with the scan copy of immigration card that I had wrongly written, I have to fill in the correct details in the new immigration card. He will sign and email Singapore embassy in India to re-verify and close the case. Verification, case closing charges have to be borne by myself. I was given the option to do the process in Singapore itself by emailing scan copies of birth certificate, passports etc. to the Singapore embassy in Delhi. Then, I can visit MOM later today to meet the officer and finish the formalities to continue my stay.

I was totally in it until he said the amount to pay was $900 for verification & $980 more for case closing! Gosh! Little suspicious now, I inquired if he is legal, he made me open mom.gov.sg website (the official, real mom website Singapore) and check ‘contact us’ page. The call on which I am is from the same phone number!! It must be true! Crazy! While he was trying to find closest sing post address so that I can make payment, I for some reason (was smart enough?) To google “MOM scam” and found that MOM website posted an alert warning users of such scams. I immediately disconnected the call.

                I have a similar experience as another lady. The person who I spoke to was Daniel Cheung. 'He' was very caring and sweet. Every day, he would WhatsApp me day & night after asking me the contact him via Facebook messager. It's started 25 January 2019. Just a few days of communication, asking me to go to the next level of relationship. I told him I 'm not ready, and needed some time. Last week before Valentine's day. He told me he won a usd5mil contract. 

He said that my prayers for him worked and he was so happy that he bought iPhone x, Mac, high heels, jewellery & cash 20k for me to spend. He showed me airway bill & photo of the items he bought. He asked me to pay for courier CHRG by using the cash he sent over. 10% would go to a charity and the rest for me to keep. Then, I received call from a courier located in Malaysia asking sgd2500 before they could make the delivery. They provided a Malaysian bank account. I went to the bank to do the transfer. The officer sensed something was not right. Advised me not to make any payment & the officer rejected my request. I told him about it. He said he will ask the courier for a local bank acct. An UOB savings bank acct was provided to me. I did an internet transfer to this UOB account as told. But they claimed the funds was not in. I called my bank & confirmed the funds is out frm my bank acct. They told me to send a screenshot of my bank acct. I'm careful to show them only the transactions Not my bank acct no. They provided me another bank acct, this time a Maybank account, and  asked me to deposit cash in it. I was frustrated. I told them I won't be paying them, but  they kept asking me to deposit cash now. I finally woke up & sensed something was not right. I called the bank & lucky for me, the previous UOB bank acct they provided was invalid acct & the funds have returned back to me. 

I sent an lengthy WhatsApp  message to Daniel and told him he was not the real person in what he wanted me to believe. 

By the way, more details on ""Daniel"": he claimed to be born in Beijing but after his parents passed away, he was raised by an Uncle in USA He was widowed with a 15 year-old son. He owns two house cost abt 350k and 450k each. He works in the marine line as engineerer, and earns a lot.   I have learnt alot from this experience and sincerely hope that others won't fall into the devious traps.

                When I was trying to rent out a common room and was contacted by this woman who claimed she is currently in China but now in doha for a conference. it seemed legitimate at first when she sent me a front and back photo of a Singapore ic ""chan wai yee""( the name was different from that of the email) and a supposed photo of her. She requested that i set up a paypal account so that she could transfer the money. I told her I didn't have one, when i actually did, to delay time. long story short, she told me she transferred money to my paypal account but when i logged in i did not see any payment made to me. i checked the email which she supposedly send the receipt from but it was a dud email. She requested that I transfer over $1450 by western union to an account in Texas USA for the freight fee for her ""furniture""/ and I had to do it by today. 

Anyway, many red flags shown along during our conversation like she couldn't even produce details about herself.

                On the 09/02/2019 I saw an advertisement at locanto for apple MacBook 13.3 256GB core I7 8G SSD offering at  S$600. I feel excited as the price was below market price. 

So, I contacted the seller via WhatsApp when asked they did not provide Cod service. And their office was based on Changi airport terminal 2. The seller advised me that if i am interested in making the purchase i can bank in the amount into their company savings account Posb savings Salamfone mobile limited 118-49735-0 The seller Even provide me with their customer satisfaction Cert indicating that Customer is 100% satisfied with their services. Also, she provided me with her ic picture via WhatsApp. 

At first, i doubted that the information given not sure whether the seller is genuine or not. Few minutes of consideration I decided to transfer the funds via interbank giro method $600 into the scammer account. 

After I do the transfer, I send the copy of the receipt to the scammer. She advised me I have to wait for 3 hours in order for the goods to be delivered. After waiting for 3 hours i still haven't received the goods. So, I contacted the seller. Then I contacted the delivery Boy. He insisted that I have to pay insurance and vat fees $300 for the custom to release my item. Which I found so ridiculous. By this time, I already suspected that This is a scammer. I request for refund for my money. The scammer promised me to refund back my money but until now i haven't received anything yet.

He claims to have a daughter whose mum died while giving birth and now living with grandparents in Taiwan. He is based in Alaska but he is using a local Singapore number for WhatsApp. He also claims to have a condo in woodlands. While he hasn't asked for money yet, he continues to build relationship with my Mom and gathering information on my family.

                We posted an advertisement to sell our stamp collection lately on social media. it was months later when a guy contacted us on social media posing an interest to buy all our stamp collection and offered 25k for all our stamp collections. 

signs of scam slowly reveal when,
1)  he did not show any interest in looking at our stamps and kept budging us to give him our banking information. 
2) his english is bad
3) when we checked on the google map, the address he gave was a shopping mall address
4) he said that he is busy in usa and DOESN'T know how to use PAyPAL (ya right )
5) last but not least, he said that the deal is monitored by fbi (as if fbi is so free)

The huge scam revealed when he suddenly send us a pic of an invoice from Grandbank and told us that we need to pay him S$450 to credit the money successfully into our account. little did he know that we have suspected him and did the essential checks. luckily we did not send any products or money over. 

Hence, would like to use our experience to remind our fellow Singaporeans to be careful and alert. to consult your respective banks if you have any doubts or enquiries. Oh and please remember not to share your bank account details.

                Met this 47 year old man on coffee meets Bagel app. was skeptical at first and didn't swap numbers till he seemed more like a regular guy and the CMB chatroom was closing. he made a mistake in the mobile number he sent on cmb so u reopened the chat and eventually we linked up on WhatsApp. Told me he was divorced with a 15 year old son (Jason), was a Swede based In L.A. (USA) and relocating to SG for a contract (turnaround maintenance in oil and gas industry). rejected his request to borrow money for son's study trip and he was nice about it. he also mentioned early on that he was the only son and his dad was sick and needed surgery but his cash flow was too tight. After his contract finished and he received his payment, he said he wanted to send me gifts. didn't want to share initially cos it sounded more like a scam, but eventually have him my home address and email and got a notice of his shipment from a Courier company (Omicron Express). Looked up courier company and had my doubts but decided to take a risk and pay USD$1205 to enable the shipment to leave the port. Then came the usual expected scam storylines of dad dying, courier company emailed to say package was held up cos of cash found in it and asking for USD$10200 PAYMENT IF NOT it will be impounded and I'll be subject to legal investigation, and pics he sent of gifts In the package that were pics from the internet. made a police report here (tip: you need to make a statement at a police station, rather than just report online via SPF e-services if criminal activity was involved). trolled him for a bit then blocked him.

Essentially, any storyline with the person being only child or orphan, divorced or widowed and with NO SOCIAL SUPPORT/friends he can turn to for help, AND if he's using sweet words and saying he loves you within a week or so linking up online, is usually a scammer. I took a risk partly out of curiosity and partly cos there were other actions and our phone calls that made this guy seemed normal, but bottom line is still never to lend or give anyone money, even if you've met THEM or spoke to them on the phone. in this case I even had a legitimate-looking courier website with tracking code and updates on the ""package"" to make the scam seem real.

                On january 4, 2019, I saw a part time employment ad on gumtree for a flexible admin job which requires just surveying the supermarkets within 2km of your house residence. i was to be paid $28/hr, with a maximum commitment of 20 hours/ week. and so given that i lack the time but was in need of money, i applied.


I first got into contact with ""arnold smith"" who claims to be a human resource manager (

[email protected]), then got into contact with ""erika andersen"" ([email protected]), the order support manager once i was ""accepted"".  i also got into contact with ""christian markovic"" who claimed to be the hr director, asking for my bank details where you want the salary to be transferred.


I was four days into doing the ""order reports"" when they asked me to register in an e-currency website. that's when i started doubting their legitimacy, and started to search for derby f&b. to my horror, this company has been scamming people from different parts of the world, targeting people to be their money mules.


lesson learnt - Do not disclose your bank details  and personal details even in an email interview. i had to quickly close down my bank account to prevent any criminal money from getting into my bank account.

Pictures of him did not look fake at all. He claimed to be an American-born Chinese living in California. We messaged every day, and he was caring, sweet and sincere. And I thought it might be a good guy. Talking for about a week and he said he had this contract which he had been pursuing for a long time and was asked to go for an interview the next day. And asked to wish and pray FOR HIM and would give me a surprise if he got his contract. Next day, he said that he had been awarded for the contract and he was very happy and did shopping for himself and things he needed for the contract and also took the opportunity to shop for me and would send me before he went for his contract work for 2months offshore. He asked for my full name and address. I did give him my name but not in full and address. He then later send me the link of the COURIER and tracking id to CHECK. I go in the link and check the status. Only showed his name and number with no ADDRESS and with my name and address. He then sent me the pictures of the gifts AND i was shocked. He said that he bought a hp laptop, iPhone x, Samsung galaxy, Scottish hang bag, ladies gold wristlet watch, pieces of jewellery necklace and mention all the jewellery are GOLD. I rejected him and asked to cancel the shipment and he said it was his way of showing his appreciation to me. He did this because he cared and loved me so much. At first, I believed him but after cooling down and doing a bit of research, I found that this courier company is a fraud, and also found many similar cases of love scams. He then sent me a picture of bundles of cash. And said that I could take the money to HELP needy people and the rest is for me and my FAMILY and also mention to meet after his contract. After that, I cut off all contact and blocked him.

                I got to know Sungho from paktor app. he claimed that he own a wine and liquor shop and has a 5-year-old daughter. 

2 weeks into our chat, he says that he is going to Sarawak for a business trip and will drop by sg to visit me. But little did I realise that my nightmare started to happen during his business trip. 

He claim that his bank blocks his account which resulted in him being unable to clear his good at the custom. Due to this, he requested me to borrow him $3000 and transfer to an account owe by hotel staff (Katherine Chang Kai Ling). He convince me by sending me a copy of his passport as a guarantee. I adhere to his instruction. For the next few days he keeps asking me for help for all sorts of reasons which include tax fee, late payment fee, taxi fee, etc. I even bought him a return ticket from Sarawak to Korea when he claims that his ticket has expired due to his business issue. In total I transferred almost US$11,000 to him. On the day of his return, he claims that the immigration officer does not allow him to board his plane due to unpaid business tax. He even request me to take up a loan for him, which I rejected. 

My good friend managed to find out that his profile picture source came from one of the Korean tv host's Instagram and prevented me from transferring more money to him. I have made a report after that. 
I urge the ladies who read this post not to follow my footsteps and beware of this person and people who you meet online.

                At Tampines blk 844

Knew a girl name ， claimed that she waas Taiwanese, a student, Working part-time by providing sex service to supplement her school fees and expenses. S$100/90Mins.

I was asked to meet her at Tampines blk 844. She asked for my HP number when I reached there, said her friend would call me to verify my identity. Her friend (Boss) called me, ask to buy top up card through Alipay as this is the first time his girl was providing service. I bought it although I had my doubts. After he called me again to provide my identity card to make sure that I am not a police. I took a photo of my driving licence, partially covered my IC number. He called me again, asked to put $600 deposit, and promised that I would deposit back after the service. At this time, I was very sure this was a scam. I told him and the girl that I would be going off, you can have my $100. 'Boss' not happy and started threatening me that he would ask 'Ah LONG'/ his guys harass me and my FAMILY at my house. He claimed that he got my HP number and photo, would have sufficient info to reach me. While I ignored him, they kept calling.

                I wanted to get a loan to clear off some credit cards thinking that they are licensed money lender and the interest rates they offer are lower than the local banks.

Initially he asked for a ""payment review"". How they do that is by transferring me $500 first then 5 days later, they need me to repay them $800 and the extra $300 will be refunded together with my loan. So on the 5th day, he asked for $200, I asked him how about the rest? He said never mind. A day later he contacted me saying the ""payment review"" was not strong. So need another review. This kept going on for 3 times and no loan was dispersed to my account. Eventually the total amount I transferred him was $3100 and still no loan. finally when I told him I don't need the loan, he threatened that I will still need to continue paying the payment review until they are satisfied or else they will send people up to my house to collect from my family.

They have Malaysian accent when they speak.

                This lady from Smart Finance (said she is from a finance company,the background was very noisy, should be this name) called me asking if I will want to earn extra income. I asked where she got my number from and she said i subscribed it hence she is sure i want to earn extra income. I TOLD HER I AM NOT INTERESTED. I asked her again from where i subscribed and she starts to get very impatient say why can't I let her introduce her product since i needed this extra income. i told her i am not interested in earning extra income and tell me where she got my name and contact no, and she starts to raise up her voice and demanded me to listen to her to introduce her product, which after that I just ended the call. cannot even tell me where she is from properly and keeps on insist that i am in need of extra income which sounds so fishy.

                29 December 2018 saw a Facebook advertisement for new product that irons shirts and trousers (company - setcoming.com). visited their website which all looked normal (had several products, catalogue and shopping cart). Reviewed the product details and conducted a short google search to find yes it is a new product launching. So decided to purchase which during the checkout stated running an end of year SPECIAL - free shipping (this should have been the red flag - overseas free shipping). Several weeks had gone by (10 January 2019), received no email confirmation and no further details. tried visiting the website to find it is shutdown and that I am a victim of a scam according to the many internet complaints - https://www.sitejabber.com/reviews/setcoming.com.

Please be wary when purchasing things online and to always, always do your research before transacting with them.

                I would like to share and report a scam online retail shop for fraudulent practices.
The is sale.vipointe.com.

Sequence of event
1)	29 Dec 2018. I made purchase of a samsonite bag on the website. This website is from US but package was sent out from China. Obviously, they operate in China which is evident also from massively ungrammatical emails sent.
2)	16 Jan 2019. A package from the company arrived at my address. The package contained two pairs of fake imitation Rayban sunglasses instead of my samsonite bag order. The condition of the glasses is massively used with scratches and a huge scarp on one of the glasses. I emailed the company on the same day to enquire about the wrong delivery. On the same day, the company returned an email claiming that they had diligently checked the package and it was the fault of the express company (courier) in mixing up the order. This is not possible as the package was in its primary packaging 2 fake Rayban boxes without further external packaging). Which goes to say that when the package was in its original packaging when the company passed the parcel to their courier. Hence, it is not possible to be the mistake of your courier. Furthermore, as indicated on the package labelling, it clearly states that it is a handbag ，which goes to say that person packing would have known the contents when he packed it.

3)	17 Jan 2019. The company emailed me again further expressing the fault of the express company offering a 20% refund as compensation and a “big discount and nice gift on the next order”. They also mentioned that should I want to have my original goods sent back to them, I would have to bear another US$25 and I would have to wait longer for my original order to be sent. 
4)	18 Jan 2019. I sent an email stating evidence to the scam. It reads as follow:

The modus operandi of the scam online website is obvious: Offer more than 50% of selling price on the website to entice potential victims. Upon receipt of order, they will send out low cost and light weight items pretending that the items were mistakenly sent out by the courier. When they get a response from their victims, they will ‘force’ their customers to send back the item which would incur additional costs which no one would since there is no guarantee that their order will be correctly sent back thus profiting from their scheme.

                So, ""DHL"" called but I guess I was blur as I didn't recognise it was a scam at first. . . Even after they spoke in Chinese!!! I asked for an English officer but they said very nicely that they were unable to get one currently because they were located somewhere else. I being blur thought it was true. When I asked for the name she said it was Tang Yi Fei. She said that I had sent a parcel out on 4/1/19 and it was held by the Beijing authorities. It contained 8 fake passports. I said I was going to contact sg police, but they kept diverting me. I eventually ended the call and they called back saying that I was involved in a syndicate gang. The number they used to call was +08610110.

                Started with his personal message through MEET-up APP messaging, saying that he was deeply attracted with me. then continued to telling about each other through email, and chat through google hangouts. i was so naive and open to share my personal matters. I feel that he is aggressive. knowing that i am single and available, he tried to win my heart; in one week he wrote 3 emails: about himself, write me a poem, and telling me a detailed story about how his ex wife cheated on him. Honestly his email and chats made me wonder if this could be real.. luckily one of several friends whom I shared about this told me sternly that this definitely is a love scam. so I already signed out my hangouts. if he emailed me again, i may just ignore it or told him off. 

I am thankful that i am spared from further lies/loss. after realising that I am his prey, I could recall more and more parts that are odd. I cannot comprehend why people can be so wicked.the evil is really there outside, beware!

                I've been receiving several calls from an automated “DHL” service, claiming that I have an uncollected parcel. I dialled 9 to speak to the operator, who obviously is from mainland China. 

Sometimes, I request them to speak English, and in response, they will hang up. Other times, I ask them what do they want since they called me, and the customer service explains that it's an automated system that diverted the call to customer service. When I ask if they are based in Singapore, they say yes. When i ask to speak in English, they divert the call and hang up.

I have tried calling back the number and found out it was a StarHub registered number. I do sales so it is hard for me not to answer calls which are not listed in my phonebook. However, the recent spate seems to show that China is abusing our security. Apart from creating awareness, please look into ways to alleviate the problem.

I let my guard down and continued talking as i also had a parcel from DHL incoming, so I mixed both details up. and thought the parcel I was receiving was detained

After the call was transferred to Interpol, they made me say out the fake parcel number which was given by DHL, and said there were 5 fake passports in it, and told me its a serious issue and had to call the Beijing police to report, after the call was transferred for the second time, my suspicions were already confirmed.

Through the conversations, I thought i could get more details from them, but the conversation was going nowhere, and I ended my call. and sent the screenshots of all the numbers to the police. nothing was lost other than my name

                I needed a loan and responded to a so called legal moneylending service i received via Whatsapp. (A chinese guy who called himself william)


I enquires about a $5000 loan with 12 months repayment. William told me i have to undergo a trial loan. He transferred $500 to my account on 10th jan and i have to repay $800 on 13th Jan. The additional $300 will be credited back to me once i cleared my trial loan.


On 13th jan i cash deposit $800 to an UOB account he provided. However, once i did that he say i should not cash deposit and should do bank transfer instead. In order to clear my trial loan, I have to cash deposit another $800 into a Posb account. Which i stupid enough to do so. I was foolish to think its will settle and i will get my loan.


After the 2nd $800 was cash deposited as instructed, william told me i need to pay $500 of processing fee. Which i did on 14th jan. Yet after that i still did not get the $5000 loan. William told me his boss ask me to pay $1000 as penalty for all the trouble.


Stupid me paid and guess what.. William called again saying since i paid so much, they have upgrade my loan from $5000 to $10000. He asked for another $1000 processing fee.


This time i told him i have no money to give. And i said to just stick to $5000 loan which i never receive. But he said amount already keyed into their system and he cant change. After which he get his ""boss"" to speak to me via watsapp voice call. The boss demanded either i pay $1000 process fee or $2500 to revert to $5000 loan. I told him i have no money and he threaten to go to my company and call my next kin.


I paid $3100 without getting the loan. I had made a police report and the police only advise me to ignore them and don't give anymore money.

                Befriended via instagram then move to wechat. self-claimed as an engineer, living in austin, texas, usa. chatted for few days then started with mushy words eg: i miss you, I love you... etc. i already knew he is a scammer, just play around to see his trick.

He wanted to come over to Asia to meet up and he chosen kuala lumpur instead of Singapore. he wants me to send an email to the travel agent appointed by his company, saying he needs to travel to visit his wife in Asia. At the same time, i checked to the official website and found out the website provided is not belong to the official network and the email address is fake too. the recommended posts are also copied and pasted from other website.

I seent the email per the content he wanted me to write. the agent replied with a cosy apartment at bangsar, kl sentral. the funny thing is, i never mentioned the date and the duration of the travelling period and the agent asked me to pay for a month upfront of U$2050 which is similar to what the scammer told. the period can be provided after the payment is made and issued in the receipt. the bank account provided is belonged to a Malaysian Malay lady. the email was replied unprofessionally as well. it is so suspicious that how can a big company appointed such a company by transferring payment to personal account? if it is an authorised travel agent, why does the TRAVELER need to pay? 

Nothing was lost. the scammer got unhappy. keep PESTERING me to make the payment and he will return the money when he touches down in kuala lumpur. I refused to do that and now he said he wants to quit his job to come for me. Ignored and blocked.

                I knew the guy from coffee and bagels apps and I only provide my what id to him to add me (i don't like giving out my numbers). The guy who claims his name is John working as a contractor (drilling engineer) and doing a contract in Kuwait  and will have a 2 yr contract in S’pore with Semcorp. He claims he is an American born Chinese, staying in Pittsburgh. 

After chatting with him for some time, he shared that he wished to settle down and start a family in S’pore and wanted to secure PR using his 2 yr contract with Semcorp (which I doubt this will work). In the mid-end he claimed that he supposed to be in S’pore, but there are some issues with the mud pump and trying to pay his Chinese supplier so that the mud pump can be delivered to him by cargo flight. Thereafter he mentioned he cannot get the money out because he could access the bank web due to the restriction in the Kuwait network and where he was situated (the region outskirt), he also claimed that the IT side told him that the only way for him to access the bank website is to get a 3rd party outside Kuwait to help him. 

He then told me that he needed to get out of Kuwait to meet me in person but he is stuck there and he cannot leave the region till he finished his contract there and got the mud pump in. He then proceeded to instruct me to visit the bank site and see whether the server work and wanted me to complete the transaction for him, he even claimed that he did this because he trusted me. 

I rejected his request and told him that it/s illegal to access someone else account. If he needed to do this real and urgent, he should contact his banker. If he had a big contract in Kuwait, he should have known that such a transaction required his own authorisation. Therefore, I requested him to forward me a photocopy of his passport and send me an authorised letter for a 3rd party to access the account. And I would forward them to our cybersecurity office to check on the website and make sure all are legal before I proceeded and this was when this ""John"" went MIA.

I hope all to be alert of such, especially online scamming, never trust anyone online till you meet the real person and get along well and ask for every detail.

                In November 2018, i saw a sponsored advert in facebook where the seller was selling a 3-axis stabilization gimbal from snoppa. it was priced S$60 instead of the original few hundreds. the purchase was to be paid on c.o.d term and so i thought i could easily reject it if this was a scam.

when the delivery was made via ninja van, i felt the box to be extremely light for a gimbal and told the delivery-man about it. he said that his role was to just make deliveries. if i have any issue, i should contact his office. so i just received the package and true enough the item was just a piece of cheap plastic selfie-stick which probably cost around $2-$5.
though i know it was futile, i wrote to ninja van and they told us to contact the seller for a refund. after an initial niceties with the seller, they stop responding to me.

their strategy is simply to make a false advert through facebook with an IRRESISTIBLE offer and cash-on-delivery offer only so that there is no way to recover the amount paid.

one month later, i saw another similar advert in facebook but for another product sold by a person called ""linna"" showing photos of the boxes of dji osmo mobile purportedly ordered by her in bulk. i asked linna if the item is not what was advertised, could i reject the delivery but she did not respond. later on, i found out that she has deleted my posts and prohibit me from further posting. i purposely wrote to her about the rejection of item on delivery so that i could hint to other users - many of them have placed their orders - not to fall into this scam.

Anyway, i have been trIed to contact the company for refund and no reSpond from phOne call it Is given And no rePly from email as WeLl.

                An automatic call to me told me (in Chinese) that my emergent delivery failed, and click 0 to talk to staff. She first asked my name and i told them (the only information disclosed so far).  she THEN TOLD ME THAT I delivered a passport to a guy called lin hua in Beijing, but address failed. after i told her i didn't deliver anything and my passports are with me, she told me that she would contact her company first and let me wait for further instruction. i have newly got my phone number on Jan 4th, but she said my delivery started from Jan 2nd. So i couldn't possibly disclosed my phone number to let others impersonate and delivery anything, it must be random call of scam. probably because i used shun Feng service before that let my guard down.

                My name is Suganth from India and working as an Engineer in one of the reputed company in Singapore. I got a call from the number +65 62382538 and they told the call is from high commission of India. They said, I have given the wrong information regarding my date of birth and it's a series offence in Singapore and I'm going to be arrested soon for the crime. And also they threatened they will inform to the employer and I will be deported immediately.  To avoid these criminal charges they asked me to pay S$10K as a fine. I had a doubt regarding the call and I contacted the Singapore police department for help and they confirmed it's a scam call. 


How i found its a scam call

1. Government never call people like this, i believe they will contact via official letter which will be posted to the registered address.

2. Government ( especially Singapore government ) never threaten people like this.

3. Initially scammer told me I'm going to arrested and later he threaten he will not do that if i pay the money he asks. I'm pretty sure government will not do this.

Singapore is a nice and safe place to like. So people don't fall into this kind of traps. Just ignore call from the scammers and inform to Singapore officials. Hope this helps.

                The email appeared in my school email's spam folder. I only opened the email a few days after it was sent. The email claimed that an email was sent from my account to myself, therefore the sender has full access to my email account. It also mentioned that a Trojan Virus through an adult site gives the sender access and control of my devices over a computer and that he is able to see everything on the screen, microphone or camera.

It then demanded that I transfer $782 to his Bitcoin account, otherwise supposed embarrassing footage of me will be released to all emails and contacts on social networks. 

I did some checking and found out that it was actually a Sextortion scam (https://www.spamtitan.com/blog/new-sextortion-scam-emails-sent-users-email-account/). The Bitcoin account mentioned in the email was also heavily reported in a Bitcoin Abuse 

Database (https://www.bitcoinabuse.com/reports/18QtUZKEsuY9gvviSsZCweyPRLSDndU6Xu?page=5).

Hope the public can be more aware of such scams and prevent themselves from falling for it.

Then after few day of chatting on whatapp, he started to sweet talk. Which i did not buy his words. 

And he stop texting. Then few day later, he start to ask me for a favor saying he sign a contract with a singapore agent. And the agent is demanding for agent fee, and whether i could pay on his behalf and he will pay me back 1 mth later. 

And so i realise he is really a scammer. And i confronted him. And he stop texting already.

                I got to know a guy from coffee and bagel and his name is John Chang Brown. He claimed to be an US citizen, only child and parents have passed away. His mother is from Singapore and dad from Albania. He said he is a drilling engineer working as an contractor for KNPC and is at Kuwait oil rig now. he cannot video call as the internet connection is bad at Kuwait. he does not have an us accent though he moved to us at 12 years old. his spelling is sometimes worse than me. he said he was divorced and his ex-wife cheated on him when he was overseas working. He claimed to be in love with me and will relocate to Singapore after his project ends. 

when we talked, he told me that his machine pump is not working well and he needs to get a new pump. he even told me that knpc came to inspect and he has received money for the 1st milestone for the project. He started to ask me to help him on 3 Dec as he cannot access his bank account as it is blocked due to IT security issues. He gave me the link http://firstcititrust.com, account code and password and asked me to transfer money to a China vendor as he needs to buy a machine pump. I could access the account and see that there was money credited into his account from KNPC as 1st instalment payment for his project (USD750k). But the money cannot be transferred out to the vendor as there was an income tax to be paid. He also asked me to contact the bank staff on his behalf regarding the account restriction and ask for instructions on how to pay for the income tax. 

I contacted the bank based on the email given in the error message when the payment was blocked, and it also matched the email address in the bank website. i blocked him when he asked me to help to pay for the income tax. 

I think this is an syndicate as the bank website was done professionally. when I went to check the bank website again, it was down and I realised that the real bank is first city trust not first citi trust.

a day before collection, i realised that anna wong has blocked me on facebook and took down her facebook page. I felt that something was amiss but decided to go forth with the meetup as per scheduled. on the day of collection, i headed down to punggol interchange at 10.30am and waited for anna wong. however, she failed to appear even after 30 minutes of wait. 

at that moment, i realised that i was scammed. i went onto facebook and wrote a post to warm my friends of this scammer so that they wouldn't fall for the same trap. on top of that, i posted on another facebook seller's selling page to warn like-minded buyers of the scam situation. the seller was very sympathetic of my situation and shared my experience to her viewers. 

through the sharing session, i found out that there are other buyers who are also in the same situation as me.

                Caller  call my hp on 19/12/2018 afternoon. He asked me if i need to loan money. I asked him where he got my number. He said his boss gave him a list to call. He asked more things but i cant hear him clearly so i said ""no"" & hang up the call. 

So i wonder if police can help to trace the owner of this hp number (local +65) & find out how he got the list of numbers. How do i alert the police or which agency can further help on this tracing? 

There are also few whats app message from overseas numbers offering loan.

                I was looking for a room to rent and i made contact with the ""landlord"" on easyroomate.com.


Things progressed quickly, with him asking me for personal information regarding the rental etc. I was alright to provide it. But strangely, i felt that he kept repeating himself in the messages because i had already answered the questions! i felt that it was strange because it seemed like he didn't actually read my replies and was giving me canned responses.


despite me asking to view the room, he didn't arrange for one and said that the current tenant was away for christmas and her mum was sick so he didn't when she'll be back. also, he said he didn't have a local bank account because it was undergoing 'linking' with his bank account in london. i know that's rubbish because there's no need to 'link' bank accounts.


the most important details was how he kept pressing me for the rental deposit of 1000 and upfront 2 months rent. i said i'm alright to pay for it and said that i need to set up a recurrent billing with my citibank account and i will need his bank account details and rental contract.


the rental contract came. it seemed to be done up on ms word with poor margins and clipart and the watermark confidential all over it. there is no attorney address or third party signature. there is no mention of landlord's nationality, passport number/ic number etc. the address of the home is generic and does not have a unit number. there are lots of clauses  which talk about late payment charges and trying to make it seem very official, however, the language use is quite poor if it were really written by a lawyer.


when i made objections, he wasn't happy to provide more details.


the bank account he gave me was an account in the UK. no local bank account, no local representative and there was an obvious rush for me to transfer the money to him and a lot pressure for me to provide a receipt.


the strangest thing is the name of the account holder. the account is registered to a man called 'innocent aloye'. when i searched it up, there is no such person to have passed the bar in london.


i am glad that i asked all the right questions. this guy wasn't able to answer them and i quickly realised that it was a scam. please be aware of such scams as the pictures provided and the rental cost is very attractive. people who have been looking for rooms for a long time will feel like its the perfect place for them and will rush to put a deposit down to secure it.

                ON DECEMBER 11, I WENT ON TWITTER TO LOOK FOR 1 BTS CAT 1 YELLOW TICKET, AND FOUND THIS PERSON (@TAEBORNSLAY) WHO POSTED A TWEET THAT SHE WAS SELLING 1 TICKET. ON THAT VERY SAME DAY, I MESSAGED HER FOR THE PRICE, AND QUICKLY ACCEPTED THE OFFER. SHE THEN TOLD ME IT WAS AN E TICKET BUT SHE COULD EXCHANGE IT TO A PHYSICAL TICKET. I OFFERED TO GO DOWN TO THE SINGAPORE INDOOR STADIUM BOX OFFICE WITH HER TO CHANGE THE TICKETS, AND SHE SAID OKAY. WE SCHEDULED TO MEET ON DECEMBER 18, AS SHE TOLD ME SHE WAS ONLY GOING TO BE IN SINGAPORE FROM DECEMBER 17 ONWARDS. SHE THEN TOLD ME PAYING CASH IN PERSON WOULD BE FINE BUT SHE REQUIRED A $100 DEPOSIT, SO SHE GAVE ME HER EMAIL AND I TRANSFERRED THE MONEY OVER. WE DECIDED TO MEET AT 10AM ON DECEMBER 18 AT SINGAPORE INDOOR STADIUM BOX OFFICE, AND SHE SAID SHE HAS TO GO SOMEWHERE AFTER AND NOT TO BE LATE. 

ON DECEMBER 15, SHE POSTED TWO NEW TWEETS ON HER ACCOUNT ABOUT SELLING THE VERY SAME TICKET I WAS BUYING. THIS TRIGGERED MY SUSPICIONS SO I MESSAGED HER ASKING IF THE TICKET WAS RESERVED FOR ME. SHE REPLIED YES SO I SAID OKAY. 

ON DECEMBER 17, I MESSAGED HER TO SAYING I WILL SEE HER AT 10AM AT THE TICKETING COUNTER. SHE DID NOT REPLY.

ON THE NIGHT OF DECEMBER 17, I ASKED FOR HER CONTACT NUMBER. AGAIN, SHE DID NOT REPLY.

ON THE MORNING OF DECEMBER 18 (OUR MEET UP DAY), I TOLD HER WHAT I WOULD BE WEARING. SHE DID NOT REPLY.

WHEN I WENT TO THE SINGAPORE INDOOR STADIUM TICKETING COUNTER AT 10AM ON DECEMBER 18, THERE WAS NOT A SINGLE PERSON WAITING TO PASS ME TICKETS. I LOOKED AROUND AND WAITED A LITTLE MORE BUT STILL NOTHING.

IN HINDSIGHT, MY STUPIDITY PLAYED A ROLE IN ME BEING SCAMMED BECAUSE I DID NOT ASK TO SEE AN E TICKET PROOF AND JUST BLINDLY PAID A DEPOSIT FIRST. REGARDLESS, STAY AWAY FROM TAEBORNSLAY AND ANYONE OFFERING YOU BELOW $400 FOR TICKETS.

                i got to know this korean guy by the name of Hyun jun smith / hyŎn jun on IG around Sep 2018. after a few chat, he suggested to chat on whatsapp & so we exchanged no. he claimed that he's working for the royal dutch (shell) as a drilling supervisor. he claimed that he has a son & his wife has passed away when his son was still small. he's looking for a stepmum to take care of his son. after a week, he started to express his feelings for me & said that i will be the right mum & a good wife. at first, i rejected but when i saw his photo on IG and the photos that he send to me taken together with his son and elderly mum look so real so i decided to accept him.


after weeks of chatting, he claimed that he has won a contract from exxon mobil & he'll be going to north sea for 1 month. afterwhich, he will come to singapore to visit and propose to me. 

shortly, things started to happen. on Nov 2018, when he started his offshore contract, he claimed that his son has been hospitalised and need money £1200 to pay the hospital but his account has been hold by his company so he's unable to pay the hospital. he wanted me to transfer 1st & he will pay me back.  if not, his son will not be able to discharge. when i told him that i have no money, he started to say that he's sick & he himself has been admiited to hospital & even send me a pic of a needle that was inserted into his hand so i decided to help him. we still chat as normal. he said that he's rushing for the contract so he can come early to visit me. 

this 2nd time around 2nd week of Dec 2018, he said he needed £1700 to pay for the filing of the documents. i rejected him again but he said since the project has finished so there's no point for him & his coworkers to stay there anymore. again, i helped him. from then, i started to get suspicious of him. 

3rd time, he claimed that the daughter of 1 of his coworker has a fall and is in a coma state. due to his account not released yet, he has no money to pay the balance payment to the coworker so he asked me to help again. this time, i strongly rejected him by saying that i have no money at all. he will pretend to be stress and keep saying that the coworker keep texting him till he can't get to sleep. 

when the time come to pay me back, he blocked me from whatsapp and even deleted his IG account. however, his pic is still there. His IG account hyun_jun_smith45

                Received a phone call from a local mobile number & was told that I’ve missed answering a call regarding the delivery of my parcel. I was told to press a no. to settle it. As it was all spoken in Chinese, I thought it’s a Chinese delivery company regarding my recent purchases on line. I really thank God for His protection. 

When I spoke to the guy, he said his Dept doesn’t handle this issue & when he asked for my name I asked him for his name first. Then I confirmed with him the name of his company is not what I thought “EHL” but actually is the well known “DHL”. And I asked for his number, he gave me his name, company no. & his extension no. So I told him I’ll check first as I’m worried that this might be a scam. 

So I put down the phone & called the no he gave which turned out to be actually DHL. But there’s no such extension & the staff there told me it’s a scam & that as long as I didn’t disclose any info I’m alright. But still I’m not comfortable about it & Im worried whether I should make a report to the police..

Also they waited me in the line for 10 mins and said your records are very clean in singapore. But in india we will receive it by next 72 hours.

They also said to go to any seven eleven stores and ask for Apple itunes and they will guide you they said. They said no you have to follow the protocol and he wants me to do what he is saying like you are a suspect.

I said i am not having any bank accounts since i am not working, he said if your wife is working kindly pay with wife debit card and credit card, i said i am not having any details about that. They are having no options after that, they scolded me and they said you are not following the protocols. i said i will come in person and asked for the contact person to meet. They just put down the phone after that.

Again received the call after 5 mins, i said i will come to ICA building directly just put down the phone.

i called 999 and also the anti-scam helpline 18007226688 and reported about this. They confirmed it is a scam and requested me to spread this with friends and families.

                Dear sir/madam,
I am an Indian. Recently , 6 months ago we moved to singapore as my husband had an OPPORTUNITY to work here. 

last month, I received a call from the number 64385121 saying that he is calling from the ica department and mentioned that I have committed some office in my country(india), they have asked the ica department to take an action on me in singapore. he asked me a few questions like how long  i am in singapore. I answered. later he asked me to take out documents like passport, dp card etc . then, i realized that it might be a prank  and said i cannot reveal my info over phone. if required i can come to the ica building and provide the details. he then disconnected.

I called the SCAM HELPLINE to enquire and they confirmed that it was a spam call and noted down the number from which i received this call. they also ADVISED me not to take this call as they might ask me to pay money to help me tackle this situation.

again last monday(5th dec, 2018), I received this call. I did not pick up. Today(10th dec 2018), i have received this call again. I did not attend.

though i am completely aware that this is a spam call  , I wanted to bring it to your notice so that he will not cheat anyone else. 

thanking you,
arthee raghunathan

                We knew one another through tantan app. We contacted via WhatsApp. He mentioned he is a Korean staying in UK working as a pilot in the British airline. After knowing him for a month, he stated he is sending me a parcel but I need to pay clearance fee. Obviously this is a scam and I gave him an empty non existence address. Finally, the courier company called demont courier service company approached me via WhatsApp asking me to pay $2.6k before releasing the parcel to me. The courier company initially do not want to release my address information. After my confrontation, it was released but it is a wrong address! And further confrontation made the communication stopped as the scammer realised I am not an easy person to scam for. Demont courier is a famous scam on social media. And joowon WILSON of course is IN a cahoot with this courier company. Made friends who are reliable, existed and trustworthy. I already knew he is a scammer so I go into a further conversation with him to drill out more of his real intentions and preventing more people from falling into his scam traps.

Now the website doesn't exist anymore and I would like to investigate if the is any possibility to recover my money and report this to authorities . 

Also I have noticed that this scam is getting bigger and bigger since on instagram appearing each day new flaw deals but coming from different web sites and people who were not scammed yet are tempted to order this expensive products on a huge discount.

Then after that passes few days, she send me the air ticket confirmation photo receipt to me telling me she already do the flight booking. 

After for sometime she suddenly ask for personal details which is name and address claiming that she wanted to send over her things or belongings over to me first, so i help her to keep before she arrives in kuala lumpur.. And says that she had to take many many things so only she wanted to courier to me some of her things first..

And that moment only i realize she some kinda scammer or whatever that wanted to scam over me. But from there i straight and direct clearly knowing that she is lying and wanted to do fraud on me.

But luckily,from there i realized and so i did not give any of my info to that person. I keep on replying delaying her saying that i will send it later..  but then she is keep saying asking me to send her as quick as possible. Saying she will need to go to post office before lunch and saying it would be late to send her things cause she claiming that she will arrive at Kuala Lumpur at December 1st 2018.

                Here is Facebook ADVERTISEMENT, which will lure you to buy the product, advertisement will show the comparison, feature, video and all possible element to win your confidence. they will table the offer at price point which is Big trap (shall be first sign we shall be CONSCIOUS of).

Most important element, they will mention cash on delivery, hence we will feel least risk to get the product, but this is the trap and beware of this.

Unfortunately i ordered this product and i got the message for ""Ninja Van"" with secure code to share at the time of delivery. you feel confident that delivery is secure - it is another trap you are getting into. 

Finally Ninja van will show up on your door and will hand over a sealed packed and demand cash. they will caution you if you open the packet it is consider receipt of delivery hence you are obligated to pay money. however if you do not open, you will establish the facts of fraud later. i got trapped and my wife (at home) paid the amount, however after opening the packet, i REALIZED that product is nowhere close what was advertised. hence i called immediately ninja van team and told them that the product is fake. 

There are many customers who have received the same packet and reached out to ""Ninja Van team"" to ensure their cash is not paid to seller and they shall be able to protect customer from this fraud. but they flatly refused me & others and informed me that as soon as i signed the delivery slip they remitted the money to seller. 

Hence, I asked them to share the details of seller name, account number and requested them to raise the matter and inform local AUTHORITIES. there did not share any details nor shown any concern about the money lost by multiple customers, which made me believe they are either part of fraud or may be creator of fraud. how can a company send instant payment to an unknown seller and that to INSTANTANEOUSLY, hard to digest this. 

Here are the symptoms you must check:

1. Great price deal - Check reputation of online seller
2. These website will not send you confirmation mail or will send you confirmation mail from alias with ""not-to-reply"" without any real contact details.
2. Check the delivery message you will get - here are steps which you help you establish the fraudulent intent
- Click on the message sender 
- Unreachable number - as they masked the message sending details
- if you respond to message it will bounce back

I felt important to share so that i shall be able to help my fellow citizens to beware themselves against these scams. Please share with your friends and relative to educate them and help them save their money.

                I met a guy on Instagram 3 weeks ago, claiming he wants to be Friends. His english is not perfect, but we can UNDERSTAND each other. He persuaded me to give him my number to add on WhatsApp because he is not allowed to use other social media during working Hours. He CLAIMED he is from us, lost his dad when he was young, and is working alone as an engineer (shells petrol) in Manchester, UK. 

He had a bad experience as his ex-girlfriend was found sleeping with his best friend. on WhatsApp, he showed a lot of love and care, telling me constantly that he loves me and wants to marry me, and that his mom WANTS him to get married. He sends selfies of HIMSELF occasionally, and he is GOOD-looking a real charmer and sweet-talker. He claims that he will come to Singapore to see me during his vacation, and he is very positive that fate Brought us together, and very positive that we will be together. 


After three weeks, he suddenly mentioned that he is trying to get a very important contract, and asked me to pray for him. After that, he came back telling me That he got the contract, and is very happy and he believes that he got the contract because of me being in his life. He said that he will work offshore at London seaport for 3 weeks, then he will come to Singapore to meet me. 

He then told me that he bought things for me to send it to me via courier. When I refused, he said I'm preventing him from going for his contract. In the end, I gave him my home address and email address. The next day, he told me he has SENT the parcel to me, and I'll Receive it in a few days. 

He added on that he kept a brown envelope of 10.5K pounds inside the parcel, which I'll be able to find after removing the items that he bought me. I panicked as IT is not right to take money from a stranger For no reason at all, what's more it's such a big sum. I also realized that it is not allowed to send cash in parcels. I texted to tell him I do not accept The money, but he KEEPS telling me That I am breaking his heart and he is doing this out of his Love for me. 

When I asked for the Courier that he used, he gave me an email address, saying that he uses it very often and he trusts THEM when I queried on the reliability. Eventually I googled the email address and found multiple accounts of scams with similar story plots, and then I realized this is probably a love scam, whereby soon the Courier will call me to ask for money. I confronted him, but he claims he is not a scammer. I blocked him after that.

I work as chef on cruise ship at the moment and I have limited time to surf the internet and  phone call is also strictly limited due to the nature of my job, but  I will still find a chance to call you.

I will also like you to get back to me with some more picture and your postal code address for me to forward it to my mover to calculate the total cost of moving my stuff to Singapore.

I'll like to move in on the 15th of December, I'm Australian. I'll also like you to get back to me with  the total cost of securing the place together with deposit. Hope to hear from you soon. 

I am a very neat and tidy person that respect humanity and this make it so easy for me to get along with whoever that comes my way in life. I'm Australian but will be coming to Singapore from my last place of employment in Philippines. I'd be arriving on 15th of December and stay for some years in Singapore working. I will be transferring the rent to you through PayPal and if you do not have one kindly set up an account with them on www.paypal.com.

I would have requested for your bank details but for the safety of you and I with giving bank details online, I prefer going through PayPal. I will be happy to secure the room as soon as you get back to me with the name and email attached to the paypal account.

                1. The scammer use facebook ads to advertise a time sale 
2. clicking the ad will go to the scam ecommerce site 
3. the website trick user to believe it is limited time sale with clock count down, but in fact the clock will always reset
4. upon payment, the goods (mobile phone) will not be sent, no tracking code will be provided
5. After reporting the scam to paypal, they pretend to resolve the case by agreeing to sending a product with a tracking code.
6. instead they basically send a cheap fake bluetooth headphone to fool paypal they had resolved the issue with delivery proof.
7. the seller is a chinese national dispatching fake chinese made poor quaLIty products from netherLANDs

Avoid buying any products from

if suspicious of a website:
1. Check who is the owner of the website via whois.com. high risk countries: china, east europe, africa
2. Use paypal to make transaction if you are somewhat suspicious of any sale
3. report your case to paypal resolution center to claim your money to cover yourself from fraud.

                RECEIVED AN AUTOMATED CALL AT 11.25AM ON THE 27TH OF NOVEMBER 2018, CLAIMING THAT IT IS MY LAST DAY TO RETRIVE MY PARCEL.


I PRESSED ‘1’ TO SPEAK WITH THE ‘CUSTOMER SERVICE’. THE MAN (WHO CLAIMS TO WORK FOR SINGAPORE POST) REQUESTED FOR MY NAME AND IC NUMBER, IN ORDER TO FIND MY ‘REFERENCE NUMBER’. GAVE ME SEVERAL ‘INFORMATION’ ABOUT MY ‘ILLEGAL’ PARCEL, SUCH AS MY PARCEL HAVE BEEN SURRENDERED AT THE  PUDONG INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT, BY THE SHANGHAI INTERPOL.


I TOLD HIM THAT I HAVE NEVER BEEN TO SHANGHAI AND THAT SOMEONE MIGHT BE USING MY NAME. INFORMED HIM THAT I WOULD LIKE TO LODGE A REPORT TO OUR POLICE FIRST, BEFORE TAKING THE CALL FROM THE SHANGHAI INTERPOL. THE MAN TRIED TO CONVINCE ME TO TAKE THE CALL FIRST BEFORE INFORMING OUR POLICE.


I FIRMLY TOLD HIM THAT I WOULD LIKE TO LODGE A REPORT FIRST BEFORE TAKING OR MAKING ANY OTHER CALLS FROM AND TO ANYONE. I THEN IMMEDIATELY CALLED SINGAPORE POST TO CHECK WHETHER THE PREVIOUS CALL WAS FROM THEM, TO WHICH THE CUSTOMER SERVICE SAID “NO”. I WENT TO MY NEAREST POLICE POST AND INFORM OF THE ABOVE INCIDENT. THE POLICEMAN TOLD ME THAT I WAS PART OF A SCAM, AND I SHOULD NOT GIVE OUR ANY OF MY PERSONAL INFORMATION, INCLUDING MY BANK INFORMATION. HE THEN SHARED WITH ME THIS WEBSITE.

                On 19oct’18, My mum received a home call from a guy stated he’s from singtel. So my mum said he will call my handphone. I didn’t know that my mum gave my Phone number to him until lately she told me so.


I Often received the same phone number on my missed call. So When i tried to call back,the line Was always busy. Apparently, the guy who claimed he was from singtel successfully called me. He’s offering a recordable set-top box at $2.45 a month after new subscription. He claimed his name was michael but he sounds like Filipino accent. He talked on a speaker phone.


Although i’ve said earlier i don’t watch tv so often eventually i agreed to his Offers. He said he will send down the item on 24th Oct but didn’t turn up. I called Singtel to verify. But Via singtel call was so difficult to get in touch with the operator so i just checked online if there’s any hold up bill, it’s none. So that’s how i thought i was scammed. The guy had my details like home address, iC number & phone number.

I placed order and text received from ""ninjavan"" claimed be their delivery guy on the said schedule & time.  the package was delivered with full wrapping materials to my door step,  after opened up the wrapping and realize that the item was not genunie and completely a fake dji product even thought it is functioning with just a few oridinary drone features.  i decided to go with my refund and contacted them via their online chats/ emails for several days but no response.  then after i realize it was a scam.  logged a police case thereafter..

                This guy added me on FB and purportedly name as ALVIN CHEUNG and claimed himself as AMERICAN BORN CHINESE. He claimed himself as DIRECTOR OF OFFSHORE DIAMOND COMPANY, living in LOS ANGELES.

HE SPEAKS ENGLISH BUT CANNOT UNDERSTAND COMPLICATED ENGLISH. DUE to his nature of work HE IS ALWAYS ON THE SHIP AND he cannot use FACEBOOK AND He requested for WhatsApp. HE WILL often CALL ME ON WHATSAPP CALL BUT HE ONLY UNDERSTANDS VERY SIMPLE ENGLISH. 

HE STARTS ASKING ABOUT ME AND LATER SAYS I LOVE YOU AND START SWEET TALKING TO ME. He says he wants to start a life and do some real estate investment and asks if I could ask for pricing from a few real estate agents and we will split the profit. I agreed he said he will transfer me the money At a later time.

A few days of conversation, he said he HAD SEND ME SOME gifts AS SURPRISE AND will send it to me by courier. A few days pass and he told me the parcel is stuck in Malaysia. He later revealed that the courier company is demanding a ransom money and that he put 1 million dollars inside the parcel. The money he promised that he will send me to do property investment.

The courier company which I later found out was fake wanted me to send 50,000 so that they can release the parcel. I transferred the money to the  courier company BUT the parcel never came. When I called them they said there was no such company and the ransom message was fake and there was no such person who provided me the Malaysian bank account.

I was angry and I asked him to return me my money. He kept saying ""relax honey, I will give you back your money.""

A few weeks later, He said he will come to meet me in SINGAPORE when his ship reach Singapore he will pass me the money. He told me when he Will meet me on a certain day and time. But last minute he said his mother fell sick and he had to fly back to USA.

A few weeks later, he kept saying that he will return me my money but he never did. Suddenly he said he had a lawsuit and needed money for lawsuit and wanted me to transfer 1500 to his lawyer.

This was when I realised I may have been scammed. I called him to return my money and he KEPt saying that he will and he kept sweet talking to me.

Finally I realised that I may have BEEN scammed. I asked him for his passport and he sent it to me. My friend then told me that the passport looks fake. that was when I realised I have been scammed.

When things fails, he will say things like ""you want problems"", i am ready for you"", i have all your details"".
Seems like he know Malaysia import tax very well, he will teach you what to write and what to say. he will rush you to send the items before you are able to check your bank account balance (as banks requires 2-4 days). he will send you screenshot of a poorly edited transaction receipt and account statement.

                Got an automated call from dhl singapore and press ""9"" to talk to someone.


he said i sent a parcel to beijing and it is being held in china due to contraband items and i told him i did not send it and he suggested i make a report to the chinese police because immigration might detain me if i leave the country and i can check what item it was then he transferred my call over.


talked to the chinese interpol for almost 3 hours. He got my name, passport number, phone number (from the call) and home address.


I was legit convinced because he made it seem so real. anyway, the parcel was a stack of fake passport. then, he filed a report for me with my statement. then, another issue came out- apparently, i was involved in money laundering and is helping this guy (Yan zheng dong), and i have a chinese bank account with money in it, and the ""guy"" im helping is caught and saying all 136 of us assisted him in this crime. he said not to tell anyone, and i'll have to give him a call 4 times a day to check that i did not ghost him (because he stuck up for me to his boss).  he even whatsapp me an arrest warrant. he said i need to prepare & hope for the best or i'll be sent to the chinese jail and have to stay there till they prove my innocence (the part where he called his supervisor to apply for some document to put me at the top of the list of the people caught and that my report will be reviewed first & said he trusts me & he put his job on the line for me).


i know it sounds crazy reading this but it sure feels real if you are the one receiving the call. anyway, after the phone call, did my google research & found some similar stories & immediately reported to the police. i can't believe i wasted 3 hours entertaining him.

                Website is offering clothes at first glance but also has sub-sites to promote electronic gadgets, in my case a Nebula video projector. I should have been suspicious about the cheap price to begin with but somehow still signed up for one piece. Address and contact details were asked on the website, however no payment details. Just cash on delivery.


I haven't heard anything until 2 weeks later a delivery company in Singapore Ninja Van called to deliver a parcel. Cash payment was done to the driver in exchange for the parcel. 

Only after opening I realized that a total other product was inside. A cheap PC speaker worth pretty much nothing.


When I called the delivery co to return the product they said once the driver marks the item as delivered automatically the sender receives the money from them and there is no way to stop this or recall the funds.


Going back to the seller website obviously no real contact details could be found and just a fake return policy page.

After holding for about 5 seconds, an operator (malay male local Sounding) picked up and said “good morning singpost customer service, how may i assist you today?” I tried to enquire about the unclaimed parcel and he asked for my full name to check in the system.

The perpetrators operate under the name “Asia Pacific Investment Pte Limited” and have created a website www.asiapacificpte.com (see enclosed screen shot) which uses the company registration number and registered office address of the actual company – see http://www.asiapacificpte.com/contact.html. 

The website (http://www.asiapacificpte.com/management-board.html) shows a list of individuals as being the “Management Team”.  None of these individuals are actual employees of APIPL.

From the website, it appears that the perpetrators are offering investment products and venture capital financing.  APIPL does not offer such products or financing.

                I recently wanted to sell my Coach Wallet ONLINE amounting to $450 and was almost scammed on the pretext of using Citibank's name to send me the confirmation order. He said he is in the US and wanted to buy this gift for his daughter in China. 

So he had transferred the money to my bank account however, after which I receive an email from Citibank Group USA  stating that I need to ship the item and provide them the tracking number for the buyer's money to go through and to be credited into my account. 

However later when I googled the email address it was: [email protected] which I believe Citibank would have a  citi.com and saw many online blogs and reviews on people who also got scammed/ almost scammed by this pretext, same method. 

This person is using the established name of Citibank to scam people with fake confirmation orders and apparently this has been happening to many. I would like to bring this to your attention and I did email Citibank in USA AND CITIBANK SINGAPORE. 
I think banks need to tighten their security in online orders especially in verifying the confirmation order are indeed from the bank itself. 

I am not sure why I received ""Citibank's"" confirmation order. Should there be any confirmation order by the banks, I think there needs to be some sort of verification to prove they are indeed from the bank itself. 

Thankfully I did not ship my item otherwise would have lost a very expensive item.

                I was looking for a dog to adopt and this person had placed ads up for a couple of Shiba inus. I contacted them and they said that the dogs themselves were free since they were up for adoption and only cared about giving them a good home. The $500 charge was only for the delivery fee from Ukraine to Singapore. After some exchanging of personal information like our home address,  I was told to wait until the animal importing agency contacted me through email.  

Everything seemed okay and believable until I got the email from ""[email protected]"". The giveaway clue was that the documents looked very unprofessional. I got suspicious and went to look up the ""Sky Petz"" and although they were a legitimate agency, their offical email was ""[email protected]"". 

I then turned down the persons offer and they threatened to sue me in court but I stood my ground because they have no basis.

I varified that the card was paid down and now I was to buy . They gave exact instructions-iphones, tool. Then I shipped and advanced the TN.  Each time the payment varified.

Afterwards, there came a time he said that they are been chase by pirates in the sea. He said he needs my assistance and he needs to send his valuables to me. So, I gave him my information. 

A day after, someone from fake Customs texted me to claim his luggage. I need to make a phone call to get his luggage. I got back with him and he got mad. He said that I had caused pain. All of a sudden he deactivated his account.

With this kind-hearted mindset end up shown that he is a scammer,when I started to chase back my money after a wk when I suggested to stop seeing each other as he makes me feel so insecure of keeping lot of secrets of himself than telling me more about him.

At first still manage to get back reply by all his fake promises of returning back money but dragging for months n even started to say he lost his job n hand tight can't return money,all these sort of excuses make a clear point of me being scammed n he started to go missing in action as time passed.

So I only can take this as a lesson even how hurt it was,do not make a police report mainly do not want to let my parent worry.I lost S$1.2K due to this scam...Hope n wish no one will get scam by this scammer in future!

First machine broke down, ask for money to fix, after bought new, need a different pump, then contract workers problem.

And when I transfer the money to buy new machine,  it was online transfer into a personal account belongs to a local In Istanbul. He said is a trusted agent. And again when I help pay for contract worker fees, it’s transfer into another local Instanbul personal account. He said he can’t risk using his account Associating with them. I believe him. 

Finally one day he said he received the 1st payment, but can’t access the bank site to transfer the money. Gave me account to do it, I saw USD3millons in there. When I did the transfer to my account ,to get back my money, suddenly the bank ask for TAC that he did not give me. And his account got suspended. He got angry and blame me. Now the bank need USD50K to create the TAC so that can make the online transfer. I already in high debts of USD122k and he still ask me to get more money for the TAC.

I was invited to an property show in Hong kong in oct 2016 organised by Event Clinic an Singapore based company. where was introduced to then AGM of Ozone Group who offered apartment at 90% value. In dec 2016 I was allotted 2apartments both in Ozone Urbana Avenue project bangalore. For which I had to pay 10% booking & avail 80% loan through their provided option of India bulls (IHFL) and disburse loan on Pre -emi (2 yrs) total loan period 10 yrs. 

We did sign documents for sells agreement, construction agreement, tripartite agreement & buy back agreement. 

The builder Ozone group was suppose provide possession of the apartment in Aug 2018. 

Under the buy back agreement option at 18 month I had opted not to retain & at 24th month Ozone group to close the loan on my behalf with IHFL & provide the 10% booking + 10% profit. 

But after RERA was introduced they changed the possession date to dec 2020 without prior intimation. 

Currently indirectly they have threatening to encash the cheques provided & process ecs linked to account by India bulls to declare me bankcrupt. Or they don't close the loan and leave victims in jeopardy.

There are more than 1000 families (NRI) trapped in the scam by Ozone group.

                Recently, I have been trying to seek some old furniture on the carousell.

Rather to my surprise, the responses I received were quite good. The responses were mostly from different usernames, short email asking like they agreed to buy and asked how to view the item. I provided the condo name (w/o unit number to be cautious) and asked him to call when reached. The person did not turn up at the meeting time. Guess that was how my phone got into hands of stranger. 

Next working day(5/11/2018) and during hour, I received a local number with SGP international code (while I am in Singapore) . The number was +65 62567574. It was strange. I answered. It was a voice machine claiming I have a parcel from Singpost and ask me to press  ‘2’ ( this is the only option available). A person with strong Chinese accent answered, and asked for my name and my NRIC number. 

Getting already suspicious,  I tried to verify him by asking what is singpost address. He could only tell me ‘Eunos Number 8’ in Chinese. I did not relent. After a few times that he could not provide me a satisfactory reply. He hanged up. I then call back the number. It was a singtel announcement indicating the number was actually not in used.

They wanted to view my room. I replied few sms and found that the call  was made from Philippines. 

They could have linked up with someone already here and will physically be here to view my room.

Scammers now won’t resort to email because this has become fruitless as more of their deeds were exposed...in fact, they will link up with real persons , who were in Singapore already, to view your room. Be careful. 

Note that you must always ask for their work permit to check with MOM before coming to view your house. This will be difficult for scammer, and you see...they will stop pestering you in case u reported them. 

Never transfer or give any money, no matter what never give away your money.

                Started with FB request, moved to FB messenger & WhatsApp. Soon he's FB profile got deactivate (this made me feel fishy) Claiming he’s from London, 35 years old, director of Operation in Chevron company. 

After 1-2 weeks, because he just won some contract, and he wanted and insisted to send a ‘surprise gift’ to me. The ‘gift’ parcel was sent by “Overseas couriers”, where there was an ""official"" website that ended up to be fraudulent, where you can also ""search""  and locate ur parcel with the airway bill he provided. Then he will tell you need to pay some custom and tax fees upon receiving, he also showed me the freight charges were GBP650 which didn't make sense to me.  I started to discover everything was so fishy and googled his phone number online and found there was another person who was scammed and shared their story, mine was exactly the same story line.. Beware single ladies! He keeps saying I miss u, I love u out of no reason! The photos he uses are not extremely cute guys, but not too bad looking and down to the earth kind which makes u lose ur guards.

Scammer's details:

Raymond Chong  Chevron energy, then told me he is from Nexen Energy (what a paradox)
Or Henry Chong/Exxon Mobil oil and gas in London

                1 to 2 years ago, while i was surfing online, there was a pop up window stating a malware attack. When i clicked in, there is an option to contact the technician support so i just went ahead. They mentioned they need to access through my computer to install the software and i allowed them. It costs $200 for a 2 years service ( no auto renewal was mentioned), so i just paid the technician and receipt was provided since they are Singapore based. Even though i felt bit cheated after purchasing their services knowing that my computer might not even have a problem ( after googling), thinking that after the 2 years i won't  be bothered by them, i just let it be. 

Just today, they called and asked whether i would like to continue with their service and i told them no. They told me that since it was an auto renewal of the services, if i were to cancel, i have to pay the remaining $300USD. I questioned them why is my card detail still with them and told them to cancel the service if not i will make a police report. So instead of cancelling, now they threaten me, told me they will not cancel the service and let it charge another 300 to 800 USD. They hanged up my phone and told me to wait for the charges.
Immediately, i called to cancel my card and make a police report.

From this incident, i have learnt not to provide any information and to google before accepting this offer.

Anyone can be a victim of scam but don't let it the incident fear you, be calm and do the necessary things.

Asked him to pay me back and he said he will transfer to my bank account the next day. However, it didn't happen. Instead, he told me that there are some issues with his business and needed me to transfer $4000 to him. It was then that I realise it is a scam. I called the police to file for report.

Through PayPal, send her the link to transfer $900 rent, and shortly after, she send some details that had transferred $2000 to my PayPal account. But nothing was credited and stupid tactics of having wait 2-5days to receive the funds. Then claimed that his/her movers need payment and offered me $100 more for the trouble, thus asking to make transfer thru WU to a subject in Shanghai, ZHANG CONG, Xian Feng Street, LP Tower.

Being scared i closed my forum account. But recently, when i finally am free to look through my account transactions, i found many many small transfers varying from 20 to 600 dollars. I have no clue when it started but called the bank to cancel all these transactions to return to their owners. Bank then requested me to close this account and open a new one.

I am Chinese, so those anonymous whose profile picture is Chinese or Mexican will send me message. I will reply, because I still believe there is good man in this world.

Few of them have similar profile, they definitely from America(I have no idea why America), some sort of professional occupation such as engineer or pilot etc.

After a week of chatting, he will start say he want to buy you something because he so much care of you... then ask for address. I rejected, and he said I don't love him. Excuse me, I barely know you how am I going to fall in love with an anonymous who just pop out from nowhere. 

I been trying to find out how much tricks they using in love scam, but few times reject, he knew he cant get anything from me, sooner or later no more news from him or his drama.

Hey people out there, dont easily trust someone you barely know him well. Protect yourself always.

                The online platform was not a real trading platform, but you wouldn't know because they designed it professionally. Their facebook page has many likes, all a set up because I am very sure that the likes are all set up by their own employees. The brokers use fake names. They use VOIP numbers and you will not be able to trace where they are calling from even though they use fake call locations like London and Switzerland. They try to gain your trust and make profit. They will use complicated money making methods and may eventually swallow your money if you give them authority to manage your account. After you deposit more money, they will ask you for more money. They will ask you whether you want  to test their system for withdrawal to gain your trust. The realisation dawned when I wanted to book all my profits and withdraw all my profits and principle amount and I am met with excuses upon excuses. They will not give you back your money. But managed to claim back much through a credit card chargeback. If I had teletransfer the money through a bank instead, all would have been lost.

After I stopped trading with them, they have been harrassing me weekly with VOIP calls from their related scam brokerage and finance firms.

Lesson learnt. Beware:
1) do not teletransfer to strangers
2) do not trade with brokers not authorised by the government
3) do not trade with people you haven't met and does not have physical presence in your country

                I am an investigative journalist and did a research on the Sugar Mummy scam circus in Singapore. They all operate the same way. No one is what they say they are. I contacted 6 of the agents on Locanto and other sites via WhatsApp and they were all scammers. They might change names but one thing is for 100% sure. You will be scammed! Basically they have a pre-paid phone card with a generic profile photo. They all asure you they are not scammers. After giving them you name, age and civil status they will ask for 300-500 SGDs for a fee. They only accept bank transfer. Then when you have payed this they ask for 1400-1900 SGD for further fees and insurance. They promise you a BMW and a monthly salary of at least 10500 SGD and so on.
My conclusion is ""DON´T PAY ANYTHING"" They are all scammers/fraudsters/liers. Don´t fall for any sweet talk or promises, you will be fooled and no sugar mummy is at the end of the rainbow.

                I saw this advertisement on how this mascara works on the benefit 1) waterproof 2) Enhance your eyelashes longer.

And it’s just simply a link advert from Facebook. It stated buy 1 free 2 at a deal of $49.

I was thinking it was pretty a good deal. And it also stated return within 7 days. After filling up my particulars and address and hit for cash payment. Something in me just feel something is not right, so I online chat the person stating that I am not keen anymore and would like to cancel the deal.
Alex is the one I spoke with, saying I am unable to cancel as the parcel has been sent out by courier service and it will take a week to arrive. I use the tracking code that they sms me to track my purchases which only able to track by the link I purchased. 
When the arrival of almost a week comes near, I recieved Ninja van send me an sms that they will be delivering to me. Subsequently, a mysterious number texted me “A courier is  deliver you a package n what is ur unit nos, and need to pay $75. I immediately feel that something is not right so I question back what parcel is this?? He mentioned don’t know and I ask which courier service is this from? He mentioned Ninjavan.” 
so I tried using the tracking code the link I purchased from to track on ninjavan website, it stated enter invalid tracking id.
After waiting about 4pm the ninjavan person came, it’s true that came from ninjavan but I am sure the company is fraud. 
Why do I say that, after I paid and retrieve my parcel I tried using the mascara it is not as what mentioned on the advertisement stating that it’s waterproof or able to enhance eyelashes. Usually mascara/ whatever makeup only able to removed by makeup remover. 
So I contact the link again the same guy assist me named Alex stating that he is unable to attend to my refund I can only contact this email”[email protected]” and I contacted them, the recipant named Gloria mentioned “ unable to refund me due to that I have used the mascara, I mentioned to her that I am not please with the advert because the mascara is not what as it stated” I want a refund.  She said” refund is only when the product is guaranteed intacted and it won’t affect the second sale.”
So I reply her that” your advert only stated that allow refund within 7 days and did not state that the products must be guaranteed intacted and won’t affect the second sale.” 
Immediately she replied stating that she’s sorry, but really unable to refund. Only able to give me a gift which she screenshot a picture of Michael Kors bag, how would a sale of $49 be given a authentic MK bag?? Definitely this is a fake one. I told her no I do not want a gift.

                Stranger asked for help to take a photo of a QR code  on his phone's received messages so he can scan it with his phone to access the link. 

My camera app automatically scans the QR code even before I click on the shutter and a malware was downloaded.

Only occured to me hours later something was amiss, and when I did a security scan, a malware that supposedly sends verification codes was detected and deleted. 

Have since disabled automatic QR code scanning by the phone camera app.

                On 13rd of October Tenerife South I was lied by an employee called Maria Jose that I cannot pay the car deposit by debit card(my credit card had expired 2 month before and I hadn't noticed). The only way to have the car according to her was to pay for their full insurance. I had already bought insurance online and I had previously paid car deposit by debit card at another car rental company(they charge you and then refund it) and I certainly didn’t want to pay extra 140 Euro for second insurance (which I bought for 20 Euro online). I tried to argue but the attitude on the other side was like: “NO, you can’t. Tell me what you want to do”. I asked her twice if she was sure it cannot be done by Debit card – she said “Yes, I am” (I have a witness to confirm). Since there was a queue of people and she wasn’t going to give me the car I paid for this shockingly expensive insurance.

                I have received an automated call from the number +6562565987, stating that I have a message from Singpost, with an option to speak to customer service. I been connected to customer care operator. 
The customer care officer told me, it is Singpost notification department, and the call should be related to some postal related matters, and  asked about the reference number to retrieve the information regarding the call, but there was none. Thus he asked my particulars to verify and I provided NRIC.  He told me that I had send a parcel to China containing contraband items, and it is hold by the customs, and is now handling by China Interpol. In fact I never sent any parcel to anywhere.  I told him didn't send any parcel to China,  and he replied someone could have misused my particulars. He soon told me in such cases Singpost will directly connect the call to China customs / China interpol, and asked if I can communicate in Chinese. I passed the phone to my colleague, as he is able to communicate in Chinese. Later after asking some details about the parcel, he disconnected the line. 
I have checked the number I received the call from in the Internet, but couldn't find any details. 

I suspect this is new Scam. This is to inform the authorities about this type of calls. Unfortunately I have provided my particulars accidently. I hope the authorities will look into this to prevent such fraud calls to anyone in future. Thanks.

                I posted an online room seeking advertisement. one day later i received whatapps msg, someone name Ms Chui offer to rent out her Novena Master bedroom at $600 (which all the criteria fit to just what you want!)
Said due to work transfer she is currently at Philippine and wish to find someone that can take good care of the apartment.

she will post out the keys and documents once receive payment. transaction based on trust.  to make it sounds real, she send the address, and facilities and photos of the house and room.

The very first thing that comes into my mind is to ask her to proof her identity before we continue. then she send me an IC of a chinese lady named Low Chui Pheng with IC number: S8019448Z.

Immediately comforting me and said she is 100% real, by the words of god, she wont be cheating on other people hard earned money, bla bla bla.

I check on google, there are posting about the similar rental scam and same scammer name/ IC being used.

Always conduct due diligence before getting into any transaction and think twice for a deal that is too good to be true.

Just 1 week before he's supposedly back, he says his project in Turkey (which he did 5yrs ago) had partial collapse so he had to fly over. His wallet got stolen and he lost his cash and credit cards. He transferred 450k USD for the materials and reached his limit for transfer without having to fly back to sign some docs (which the Turkish company didn't allow him to).

                He will be nice to you and make you think that he is close to you. He will chat and make video calls to you. [July 2018]

After a few weeks to a month, he will inform you that he has some good information on Gold and oil trading news. 

He has been earning big money. He will also say that he is out of a relationship and he cannot find and lost his past relationship. He will mentioned that he is a business man. But recently, we tried contacting him with another phone and he mentioned that he is working in fashion industry.

He will let you make 2 successful trades. Then he will ask you to put more money into the account to make it VIP with more leverage. To be a VIP, you have to input 50k USD. 

On a night in late August, he informed again to make a trade. He gave the wrong amount of lots to buy in Gold and it burst the limit and make a lost of 28k USD. 

After the trade, he will console you that he will help you in 3 months time with hard cash of 100k USD. 

He will then tell you to borrow money from friends and banks to make another trade. Of which, i was so silly to believe it and waited for my Bonus to try 1 last time about 3k USD. Again it was lost through trade. 

He will again console you and say that he will drop by Singapore and help me out as he promised. Again, he tried to persuade me to take loan from bank and promise a better information this time round. However, i cannot bring myself to trade on the expense of others. Furthermore, i have already lost my saving and my parents are retiring. I cannot afford such actions and worried over the consequence what may befall me and my family. 

After which in mid October, he mentioned that he is very busy with his business and he has to delay his coming over to Singapore to November 2018. I have tried to convince him to provide a date. But all he say is that he understand and will try his best to come over. 

On the 22nd of October 2018, he blocked my line chat and then only then I realized that i was totally scammed.
so in total, i lost about 80k USD plus without calculating the cost of remittance fee to the trading firm in Hong Kong.

                September 9, 2016 when he first contacted me on Facebook. He message me a lot with his alluring words and it take more than one year before i accepted the love he offered. I thought his love was genuine because he even show his (psuedo) family and (fake)friends almost everyday. He even showed me his university classmates and i did a lot of university research,.assignments and exams for him because i really he loves me and he even offered me to marry him with his psuedo mother consent. He first told me that he have a kind of sickness and he needed money for hospital check ups. Then he asked money for tuition fee,  for iPhone and  and for Assorted clothes/Accessories. As the months went on, his demands keep increasing and he will get angry if he can't get wgst he asked. Most of the time he keep parading his naked body and do masturbation on camera even i am not asking and against my will. He confessed he have a lot of sex partners online and most of them cougars ages 48 to 60's. He keep revealing his real color as i often times caught him lying and manipulating me for the sake of his oldest lover on viber. Until the time came that o found out that it's not really only me who is sending money to him because other girls came out too and revealed his secret. All his victims aside from me are professional single mothers and married women. (I'm not married, I'm single and young) His vices and addictions  with money and online sex became severe and he can never hide anything from me anymore so he decided to blocked me everything, and did a first move to destroy me. I fired back too on social media but unfortunately most people on his side believe him. He is an  Iraqi Kurdish man and first introduced himself as a government employee then suddenly remove from work. I seek many people in Kurdistan whom i thought can help me get back my money but  unfortunately no one who extend a real help since I'm only a foreigner. His other victims remained silent when i tried to convince them but 2 of them boldly shared their stories on how this man made them suffered online. If you look at him, you can't tell that he is evil person since he look pretty tame and speeches on public. As of now, i.am sharing to other women of fb that just in case he will try to lure them, they must be alert and don't believe him. He is not willing to pay me back though but I'm sure he will learn a lesson about me sharing my experience with him. He verbally abused me too so i can't help but fired back too on social media. I hope my story will serve also a lesson to every single out there. "" Beware of wolf insheepclothing""

                Was scammed by the Music Bank concert last year. He stated on his Carousell that he was selling away his tickets due to his grandma was sick thus he had to sell off his tickets. After dealing & transferred the amount, I sensed that something was wrong. So, I search on Twitter with hashtag music bank & saw one scam post with the same bank account number I just transferred. I contacted that person who got scammed & found out that I wasn't the only one. Apparently he had scammed many of others by using different excuses (he scammed with other events as well). Made a police report (in fact all of us), but no response until now, a year later.  We somehow got a hold on who he is as he sent his IC photo to one of the people who got scammed but not sure how true this is as he might be using someone else's IC. He created new Carousell accounts with different username everytime we reported spam. Each username got suspended. I'm pretty sure he's still out there. A year later, still no update from the police.

                I received an automated voice call yesterday and today from ""OCBC Bank"" to return call to them. The caller ID number showed +6565974416 and voice message asked to return call to OCBC at +6563199753. It was not a usual type call from a bank and the number differs from the bank's main telephone number. I called 63199753 and got an automated answering system that answered with ""OCBC Bank...."" which is different from the genuine OCBC main line number at 6363 3333. I called the caller ID number and got a male chinese person answer call saying ""this is OCBC Bank"" and he asked for my NRIC number which I declined as I cannot verify that it is OCBC Bank. He said he cannot proceed further and that I should contact OCBC Customer Service, which is strange, is he not customer service or officer of the bank to assist? Thereafter, he hurried with some words and hung up. Fairly well set up and suspicious, otherwise its just very bad customer service. Yesterday, I called the genuine main line and spoke with a customer service officer and asked anything that the bank needed to speak to me about and said he has no information on that. I gave him details of the suspected fraudulent call and he said he will check and come back to me. No return call yet. As I have not lost any money, personal information, and anything else except my time and annoyance, I will not be filing a police report for the time being. Too many of these going around and this is a good platform to share so that others will not fall prey.

                Massage service found at locantos. I went for the appointment but the girl didn’t show up. Instead she ask me to pay her $100 through Alipay at axs machine. She said this is for safety reason. Later on she messaged again and said one person will call me to verify my identity. The all came and called claimed  that he is the boss. Ask me take a photo of my identity card to the girl. And another $1200 deposits. He said the girl will refund all to me in cash when we meet. And they are very smart, the girl told me she cannot withdraw the money til I pass her the receipt so I thought control was with me. After paying $1200, the boss said I have to pay another $3000. This is to ensure the girl are protected during the service with me. I refuse and quarrel with him on the phone. He then threatened me with messages as usual, quoting that he is from secret society. He will track me down using my identity info and mobile line. I think police should crack down this syndicate as soon as possible as they started to threatened the victims with secret society linkage. 369, ， and his name is . Apart from this AXS should also do their part by giving warning sign on their screen that once you purchased, the control go to the other party through email address. I called up Alipay and seem like the serial number I have given them are being used or lock. I called axs and they push me back to Alipay. I give up. Lesson learnt. Want a normal massage and was conned $1300.

                Was searching online for Havianna slippers for my kid. Came to this website called Flopstore. The prices look reasonable and it has a Facebook with more than 1000 likes. And everything looks pretty normal to me as website also provide reviews on the product sold.

I used my UOB credit card to make this online purchase. Strange thing is that it didn’t ask for password authorisation as most of my online purchases will require this.

2-3 days later, I tried to check the status of my purchases by creating an account to check. Strangely, the account went to junk mail. Also, when I tried to check, I received no such order. So I tried using other ways to trace it. Did manage to track but status was still processing. Somehow, I just felt uncomfortable about this online purchase since it is first time buying from this merchant which is in USA.

I called my credit card company to stop this transaction. However, the money was already claimed 2 days after my transaction. I knew then that things are not right.

Though I tried to reach out to Flopstore, I last heard from them is they will refund my money. However, my money was never refunded to me. Guess, it is a lesson learnt. Luckily, purchase is less than $70. 

Useful learnings to share:
1. If you look at Facebook website of merchants, they usually have feedback from customers. However, Flopstore websites does not have. Could be 1 tell tale sign.
2. Even with more than a thousand likes on Facebook may not guarantee that it is a real online merchant.
3. Try to put in a review on their online website. For Flopstore, you realise that if your review is negative, it will never get through. This also means that no way you can ever complain.
4. Check online for reviews. I chanced upon this website, Trustpilot. Saw a few reviewers saying that this is a SCAM website. But too late for me then. However, there were some who did put in good reviews and I believe are fake. If you see more than 3 SCAMs comments, NEVER go for it. 

My wish list moving forward. 
I hope that we can compile a list of online SCAM websites so that when we want to make online purchases, we can check against the list. But this compilation needs community contributions and I hope to see that everyone can contribute.

                We connected on Meetup app, he claimed that he was from Texas, having to go back home for 2 weeks before coming to Singapore for work. Asked me to view his penthouse that he’s going to rent but have to confirm within 2 days. I reluctantly accepted since I was in similar situation before but couldn’t find help. Also asked me to email his agent and add him on Skype. Then he asked for my address to send his documents and a $7000 check so if I like the place, can help him hand over that check. I found this too weird so gave him a fake address and went online and found out 2 similar scams. Be wary ladies!

                I can only say, very stupid and expensive lesson learn from this. 
Cut short my story and summerise it. 
come across advertisements in Carousell. so try approach. Claim they r license and show me their past invoices,then ask for documents to prove income, once they say ok, fund of 500 was in my bank as inform and say that, because I m new account, need to process this loan first and never sttle,always defer final payment and when I wanted to close account and they ask to pay 50% of e loan amount or continue to make at least 3 defer payment and 1 final payment, but it never take place. This is what gold credits done to me.
As I was in need of money badly, contact ML credits and ask them that if my loan is approve, but I decided to drop, they say no problem,so same procedures to process, Same things happen, 500 was transfer to my account and told me to clear next day to proceed, when I do fund transfer to them, they claim not successful and want me to do cash deposits, after that fund did not come, so I cancel and they want me to pay for close account. Thinking that it can be solve after all this payments, you are wrong. I have decided not to pay them any more and waiting for their actions now. Almost forgot, ML also offer me to work for them as ATM porter.

                this person used Tinder App and asked for exchanging whatsapp for communication. 
he sent the pictures of onduty photos of cruise even pictures with uniform and name tag, and event pictures on the cruise to make I believe without doubt. 
Then he sent a flight schedule to show his willing to visit my country but it's wierd the itenary showed several transportation destination in different country since there's a direct flight could be choosed. 
There's one transportation of Malaysia. 
When he arrival at Airport, he said he would need to process ""little thing"" then told me to pick up the phone from one custom staff , said the staff would called me just couple mins later.  (well, i didn't believe that custom would make this call), and this custom staff (woman) spoke my language. 
The reason that ""custom staff"" said was he carried a lot of money and gold without certificate to prove that he owned those gold, but she was helping him to get the certificate, the total fee is USD 16XXX, and he already paid 13XXX and balance would be 2000 USD rest of the money need me to help. 
I was rising my red flag while i saw the itenarary, thus i told the so called custom to suggest this person to claim the allowed amount and i have nothing can help on this. 

In this case i didn't lost money but lost of trust to people again. And need to deal with depression attacks on me due to this scam. 

I wrote it out because i hope people not be scammed like me by this kind of lie.

As you click, the link is not from apple official website, though the layout exactly the same with apple official website. 
I only given partial of my personal information that I immediately change in the official website once I realized the scam so that further lost can be prevented.

                I got scammed by a Sarawak Malaysian women living in Singapore, justice has eyes and I found her on Facebook. This is a cunning auntie who did all means to portray her integrity as a seller. Long story short - she approached me about the perfume I was interested in. It was a Si Rose Signature II Eau de Parfum by Giorgio Armani. Brand new in bag, authentic was what she advertised. She priced it at 65SGD and offer to negotiate with me, I tried my luck at 40SGD and accepted immediately. Asked her if it was authentic she told me to verify the batch code online and with the physical box. She mentioned that the perfume was from a Europe trip. She requested meetup at Toapayoh/Bradell to check and ensure its in good order but I told her to just mail. I offered and she accepted and provided free mail. I transferred wrongly to her and asked her to transfer back the excess 25SGD, she did via Paylah and that I got hold of her full name -Doris Crossley Nur Hidayah Bte Abdullah. Item came quickly and she even did smartpac (~6SGD) for me, problem come when I open the pack - all signs of fake perfume.

Si Button was poorly pasted on the bottle; not centrally

NEW YORK was spelled as NWE YORK

Pour Femme but label indicate Pour Homme for a ladies perfume

The golden square at the base was attached by a gross amount of glue

The external plastic was secured with scotch tape

the volume of the ""perfume"" look used

Initially, I only questioned about her about the used status caused I haven't suspect of a fake item, she mentioned ""its new but been keeping it for a while since my last birthday"" I still then tell her nicely to do something about it but and offer to change perfume. By now I realized an even bigger problem - I got a fake perfume. I stated the obvious that it was fake and I didn't want any of her perfume and I want a full refund. She mentioned she had never faced this before and offer an exchanged. By the following day l left her a negative, and this scammer still shamelessly dare to give me negative but this time forgetting what she mentioned earlier and say she's receiving the payment for her friend and the perfume is from Malaysia! (Before the deal, she told me it was from Europe)

She went on to create a new account to scam people, offering meetups. I wanted to reach out to the people in Carousell so I spam all her public chat box. Some interested buyers saw my spam and PM + update the conversation with her - the slightest benefit that she is unaware of her fake perfume was eliminated - the real-life photos she privately shares with other sellers was obviously a fake.

                Thought it was a ‘legal’ investment company based on its ‘advertisement’ on so call safe website. Cut story short, I’m was advised to place $$ with the investment company. They even gave a lesson via telephone on how to invest. There were many calls and emails from the company. After many pressures and calls from the company and calls from my personal ‘investment advisor’  I paid >$10K by credit card to the company.  Subsequently I wanted to withdraw part of my investment, I had much difficulty making the withdrawal as  each time the company would reply that my withdrawal was being followed up by the accounting department. Even so, I must send them my personal documents such as copy of IC or passport, copy of PUB bill, etc. They even asked for my bank account no etc so that the refund would be credited to my account. This never happen even after I had gave them all the information. Eventually all my emails were not replied and later my emails to them bounced back. It was then that I had realized that I have been cheated of my money and there is no way I could get my money back.

                I was contacted through Facebook by a man called Klint Hendris who said he was an Engineer working in Liverpool, United Kingdom. He claimed to have an 11/12year old son who attended Boarding School whom he ""visited"" every 4/6 weeks. We went off Facebook very quickly and moved onto email also for a very short time and then we spoke via WhatsApp. On two occasions the first was to surprise him that I was coming over he nearly had heart failure and the second time I was going over on Holiday with my Mom and we were going to meet up at the last minute he said he couldn't as he had been awarded a contract in Dublin. Each month for a year and a half I sent money over to different cell numbers I actually couldn't say how much but you can imagine. He was always so loving but his English both verbal and written was very good. I have learnt my lesson the hard way, but am picking up the pieces and moving on.

                Hi everyone, 

Recently, i met someone via wechat. We have met through the app wechat via people nearby function. She acted as a tourist that have come to singapore and ask what is there to do in singapore. Being a nice person i told her what is there to do and shop in singapore. We chatted for quite awhile, even when she says that she have a short trip to singapore. So, until the day has come, she says she wants to send me alittle present, i was doubtful at first. She pretended to be nice even though i rejected her,i grew suspision as well. So i gave her a fake address and phone no. For her to send her little present. And she said she send over the next day. The next day have come , and she told me she had to pay roughly 80sgd to send over, however i had to pay the rest of the amount of 222sgd to the delivery logistic to collect the parcel. 

 So, in conclusion i exposed her and she never text again.
Beware of online scams as they use your kindess and trust to scam you off.

                Start to apply online fast loan. Submit my details via online. Than received some text messages about loan. They even mention about monthly repayment schemes.

So got attracted to their package  and contact them via whatsapp. Than the person ask for my details for verification. After the procedure, they will ask to video call, send proof of documents like payslip, letter of employment, NRIC front & back. 

Later than they will say our loan approved to this amount and will give details about repayment method etc.

They will start with weekly first and say later on can to monthly if our payment is very good on time.

For due dates, they won't allow us to repay in full to them but tell us to defer for that week because they cannot find an account number to transfer.

This carry on until for few months than i realise why should i pay more than the amount i take????? This is really a scam. 

After notice this issue than i made a police report and now they are harrassing and threatening messges and burning house video to show me what they will do if never pay. This monkeys are really very annoying, disturbance, emotionally getting us into depression. So what we got to do is make a police report and ignore their calls, block them & report as scam.

                This guy claimed himself as James Chan, was borned in Singapore and studied at UK since 8 years old. Own few businesses in UK and owned a private jet.
I knew him from facebook, then we talk on whatsapp. He never do any video call with me, always said camera broken on his phone. 
After couple weeks, he said sending me some money to help me out with loan. He gave info about his account manager, named Kelly Hauer and the bank called Glabal Inland Bank. First Kelly they will send you all the application forms, once account setup, there’s an account opening fee of USD5100. I made the transfer to another agent in the states not to the bank directly. Once they received the payment, a password with username was given. I saw he transfer USD one million into the account but when i starts to transfer the money it blocks me from doing that. So, I received the message from Kelly saying that USD23000 needed to activate the account in order to make a transfer. I was shocked and didn’t pay that as I cannot afford. Now the account is block. 
While chatting with this guy, James, he told me he’s working at overseas and recently at china. First, he said he left his laptop at last work place and ask me for help to send him a apple laptop, which i did and he will give me a different shipping info (not sending him directly). Now he said he’s short of cash at china and needs USD 10000 to finish the project so he can come and see me. I didn’t send him the money and now he’s disappeared. 
His phone number is +447513168938.

She told me her name is Amelia, 27 year, non smoker, single coming to Singapore. She claimed she work as chef on cruise ship at the moment and have limited time to surf the internet and phone call is also strictly limited due to nature of the her job, but she will find a chance to call me. She then saying want to know the total cost covering her first three months` rent together with deposit so she could plan her budget. Sound too good to be true??? She also wants me to send her my room pictures and postal code for her to forward it to her mover to calculate the total cost of moving her stuff to Singapore. She even attached her don`t know if is her picture or simply get it from any website and waiting to read back from me soon. 

At first, I had already getting suspicious when I first receive the sms from her. But because I had wanted to rent out my room desperately thus I tried my luck. When I know she is a scam, I did not do what she wanted me to do just replied with thanks for your reply, noted.

The next day, she replied me and telling me that she is a very neat and tidy person that respect humanity and this make it so easy for her to get along with whoever that comes her way in life. She claimed she is an Australian but will be coming to Singapore from her last place of employment in Philippines. After so long reply, she telling me to set a Paypal account and saying will be transferred the rent via there.  And saying she will be very happy to secure the room as soon as i get back to her with the name and email attached to the paypal account. 

I hope given my story here, all landlord will be aware of this kind of scams well there is no so good stuff pay in advance 3 months while we never see the person face to face before.

                Louis contacted me about helping to sell his items, promising to bring the items to me on a certain Wednesday. When he did not, I asked him about it and he promised again to bring it again on the next day. This kept repeating, citing work reasons etc. I even told him at the start that if he had problems bringing the item to me, that we could shift the date of the sale, but he insisted that he needed cash urgently. So (silly of me), I trusted him.

After I found buyers for his item (who made deposits for it), I informed Louis about it. Again, he told me that he would pass the item to me the next day. The pattern repeated. This went to the point where I had to have a friend call him and he said the same thing. How shameless. The next day, he refused to pick up my calls or to respond to my texts (despite his status being online).

The buyers had to be told that the item could not be given to them. And naturally, they were not happy. 

I do not know what pleasure Louis derives from this but it is a very simple gesture to simply say that he is unable to deliver the items. Why make others (the buyers and myself) go through so much inconvenience and trouble as a result of his inefficiency and straight-up cowardice?

I hope that others will beware of such scams and such irresponsible (and perhaps sadistic) persons. Even though I did not lose money, I lost the trust of customers and a lot of time.

Know him for about 2 weeks, never ask for money. (May have lost my photo).  He didn't seem to rush things.  Decided to ask him for his surname, after I did a reverse check on his photo. He used a Chinese singer's photo (). That's when he knew he was exposed.

Found a pretty Mainland Chinese girl on Tinder with a WeChat ID in the bio. Conversation on wechat quickly moved to meeting up for sexual services. $100 for 2 hours or $300 overnight (a common number used according to this forum)

Then gave me an address to meet at 512 Bishan Street 13. Upon arrival I was told that apparently she doesn't take cash due to the risk of 'counterfeit bills'. I was called by a male middle man who spoke only Putonghua, which was difficult due to my limited speaking ability. I was then requested to buy an Alipay voucher of some sort, upon revealing I didn't have a credit card I was asked to buy an iTunes gift card. 

I was suspicious from the very beginning and repeated requests to meet the girl first or have some kind of proof of reality were ignored. 

If you are asked to go to 512 Bishan I can guarantee you it's a scam!

                This person left a message on a room rental forum asking me to email instead and then left the forum and deleted her account. She then emailed me after I made contact with her, and stated that she is coming back home and needed a place urgently. After a few emails which included a picture of a singapore IC to ""verify"" who she is, she claimed to have made payment to my paypal account and added over a $1000 to pay for her movers and another $100 for me to help her run errands. Then asked me to transfer money over to her mover. My suspicion grew when the money transfer account was in Philippines but she said she lived in China. Then a series of emails came, first politely asking then begging me to quickly transfer the money otherwise she will incur additional costs as the moving company needed the payment. I found it weird that she referred to her IC as license and that her English was so broken and so not Singaporean. I refused to transfer the money until I received payment and then she disappeared.

                On Thursday I had put my phone  ( google Pixl2 XL) on sale on Carousell.sg. Same day i received a message from a Malaysian Number. asking for the price and if i can give some offer. 
I said I can give him in 600SGD. He said ok and he insisted that the parcel needs to go out soon as she has to gift to someone. 
I said ok, and asked him to transfer money. He transferred the money but I didn't received it. He then said its  Band Of America( US account) as he is a US citizen living in Malaysia. 
I told him I cannot send the parcel Just like that, so he send me the screenshot of the transaction, his statement and also his passport. He gave me a Condo Address in Malaysia. 
Thinking that all seems genuine I sent him the parcel on Thursday(11/10/2018) which he confirmed that he has recieved on Friday. But after that I keep on chasing him for money, He said check with the bank. 
Today ( Monday- 15/10/2018 ) - i tried calling him, on phone , via whatsapp. it got number unavailable, and now his number is not on whatsapp. 

So, I gave my google pixl2 xl, in 650 SGD and didnt received any money.

                She negotiated for almost half the price of my listing. I gave in and did not complain because it’s my very first birthday gig in Singapore. She told me that she wants to have helium balloons, and I told her to look for another decorator, cause I can’t find helium balloons in less than a week while I still need to order and pickup everything that she wants, and I need to cater to others’ demands too. She said it’s okay and she still wants me to be her decorator. The next day, she made her downpayment smoothly (50%) and still told me she was going to find the helium. The day after, she told me to get and pay for the helium tank that she ordered. (It was 2,5 hours away from my place. She told me that it was not heavy at all, turns out, it was very heavy. I told her to pay for it, and she agreed to pay for 80% of it. The day came, and her birthday cake that I paid for and she got for free from me is a bit damaged, I paid her $5 to cover the damaged cake that I did not charge her for. When I was finished, I looked for the knife and candle that I bought, and she did not help me. When she asked me what I was looking for, I told her, and she kept on complaining about how I don’t have it and lied about having it. Turns out, she threw it on the huge plastic that I brought from home and she was ready to throw it out. She still complained and told my friend that was supposed to pick me up to get her 60 helium orders at this party supplier. It was worth $96,80 and she promised to pay it back last Friday. She never did, and blocked me on every social media. I called her on her cell, she picked up and told me that she’s not willing to pay the outstanding amount. I reported this issue to the police. I just want to bring awareness to everyone. I saw the one and only review that she has on Carousell is terrible but I ignored it. I hope none of you will be scammed by her again next time.

I bought an gimbal, it is said to be $65 cash on delivery. However, the delivery man refused to hand over the parcel unless we hand over the money first and refuse to return the money when we realized the item is fake- just a $5 selfie stick. He requests that we contact the seller as he is just courier only.

But the seller was unresponsive and we realized then there are several other victims. One of them shared that his address was on our delivery box because it was delivery to him earlier, as the sister was already conned, he refused to accept the delivery.

It's Fujifilm Polaroids/Cameras/films on 50% sale. It even has got Fujifilm logo on top of the webpage. Thus proceeded to purchase it online.

I shared with my friends on the promotion, and that is when my friend told me that it could be a scam as the wesite link is not actual Fujifilm website but the below link.

""http://camsrw.online/index.php?main_page=index&cPath=2""

But I tried to convince myself that the item will be delivered to me.

After 2 weeks, the item still has yet to arrive, but I thought that probably its a slow delivery. 

I waited for another week. Just when I go into the website wanting to login my account and check on the status of the delivery, the link is no longer valid.

This is when I confirmed that it is indeed a scam.

The offer was on COD (Cash On Delivery) basis, so I thought that it would be safe to order. 

I ordered through the web page last 30Sep2018, 0748H.  The package was delivered 8Oct2018, 1400H.

The package was delivered through Ninja Van with tracking # YJYSG111075529699.  The box was properly labelled with the item I ordered, so I released the payment of $65.00 SGD.  But after opening the package, then you will discover that the content is just a cheap analogue quartz watch.

I called up Ninja Van Customer service (I was able to talk with Arnie, Lukman, Aisyah) to ask for help to stop the payment, but they said they cannot stop it, and informed me to write the complain to the international forwarder named : SHANGHAI ONE PLUS ONE INTERNATIONAL LOGISTICS CO.

I sent the email and got a reply from the customer Service named Marigold He.

but there is no more reply now, and I will try to follow up.

I will also be seeking the help from the SG police regarding this item.

                Sponsored Facebook advertisement showing baobao bags on sales. To purchase, buyers do not need to disclose credit card information. Just key in residential address for bag reservation and payment will be cash on delivery. 

Without much thought, what’s the harm of sharing residential address ? No credit card info is disclosed anyway. 

Went ahead to key in. Within a week, a delivery man came to delivery the “authentic” branded good. And ask for the cash. Suspected something was amiss, but stupidly paid the cash of $99. As the delivery caught me off guard, I didn’t expect it to arrive. 

After checking good when the guy left, it’s fake. No warranty card, no authenticity card you get from branded goods, no brand stated, and the goods does not match what is shown online. 

I guess we are protected by lemon law for goods purchased that did not match, wanted to raise alert of the Facebook post site: http://www.qeasdx.com/SGIM that has not been taken down. 

So I went ahead to make police report. And the outcome was.... a letter received from SPF 2/3 weeks later, saying “due to insufficient evidence to prove criminal record, they are not able to proceed with investigation.” My option is to file for civil litigation that is gonna cost more. 

I am dissapointed with the reply from SPF. No followup conversation from police force to ask for evidence. Before they deemed this case “closed”. On my end, I am trying to raise public alert. 

1) the website is still active.
2) I had cctv installed at house premises, where I capture the delivery guy face
3) the parcel contains no delivery company such as dhl / SingPost, no contact number, just COD. 
4) I pass the cash to the delivery guy. Who is he working for and who did he pass the cash to ? 

All these were my queries, and without investigation, its closed. 

Oh well, on my end, I had learnt it the hard way.

                Placed an ad on gumtree to sell my sofa.

Guy comes and claims he bought stuff from SG before. Lives in china now with his father.
For me, these were red flags.
Then offers to buy the sofa for the price i gave. And wants to do paypal transaction. 
He asks me to check inbox or spam folder after he paid. So now I know for sure he is sending me phishing mails.
I told him I know of his activities and reported him to authorities. 

Please stay vigilant in these cases. Use your secure account apps or directly to check whether the transaction is legit or not.
Most of all, don’t feel pressured by them telling you they already sent you the money. PayPal transactions are instant, so there are no delays!

                Met person online he contacted me. Not sure why, was rather flattered by sweet words. Then things got intense. Kept calling texting messages etc. Finally shared personal info on himself and I was rather moved by this. Till asked me for to send a amazon gift card. Duh I'm in Canada he in NY this wouldn't work. Caught him in a lie over some pics on Google plus. I told him was NOT a man.He blocked me. But kept telling me he found what was looking for. I'm married he knew this. But still I wonder if was bsing or wtf. No more texts emails or calls ...suits me fine. This went on for months. I found ironic he cared enough to call me when I was in hospital. Always asking about me but very reluctant to share himself. Pics of him and his daughter same on Instagram and Badoo in same sequence. Found out is not a 48 yr old man but someone named Eugene 22 yr old.Story don't add up.

                Currently, we have invested to USA Fox Ridge project in 2015 through the Citation Capital Asia Pte Ltd company in Singapore. The MD of the company is Chew Chuan Tin and we have made many attempts to contact him and he is uncontactable as at current status. From our understanding, there are more than 1,000 Singapore investors who have invested to various Citation projects via seminars conducted by Chew in Singapore.

Additionally, SPF reports have been made on the company and we were informed there is a White Knight buyout plan in process but in the end, we did not receive any payouts or buyouts on our Citation investments.

Recently, the parent company in US, Citation Communities operated by Larry Miller also declared bankruptcy in August 2018.

Thus, we will like to urge the Singapore authorities to step in to investigate Chew and his company, Citation Capital Asia Pte Ltd and enforce the return of funds to Singapore investors as soon as possible. We also urge all Citation investors to make police reports on the company as soon as possible. Thanks.

                Polwebuy is based in Xiamen, China and sells Polo/Ralph Lauren garments. The scam works like this. You see something you like, and pay for it on their website. You then get an email saying it's ""out of stock"". You are invited to pick something else. This is also ""out of stock"". You then agree to their suggestion that they will send you ""something similar"". They send you a piece of rubbish. If you want a swap/refund, you must use recorded delivery to return the item, which costs a lot if you live overseas. I doubt many people bother to follow up. And I bet they count on this.

                Purchased an iphone from a seller on Carousell over the weekend. For the price they had offered, it seemed like a good deal as much as I had my suspicions. I must have been stupidly blinded by the deal and made a deposit of $200 as requested by him to secure the order. The transaction was to a local DBS Savings account number 120-110253-8 (City Mobile). Based on past experience, putting a deposit is actually a normal procedure when purchasing big ticketed items on Carousell as this eliminates uncommitted buyers. 
-
Upon making the $200 deposit, I was informed that the courier would be in touch with me regarding my parcel. The next whatsapp I got was from a Malaysia number +60 14-986 1913 claiming to be from ‘Parcel Courier Express’ www.parcelexpress.co and shared my order details that included a tracking number. I proceeded to do a basic check on their website and typed in my tracking order to make sure it was listed. It was pretty legit, but I started to become a little skeptical because the ‘courier’ required me to make another transaction of $220 claiming it was for insurance and assured me that $205 would be refunded to me when the parcel arrived. And since it required me to make the transaction to another local bank account, OCBC Savings 5400026745, I thought to myself that if this turns out to be a scam, at least I know details of the scammers can be easily extracted by the police. 

So that’s $420 of my money so far. An hour later, I received another text saying the parcel is on hold at customs and they required me to make another $380 for ‘clearance’. Right this moment I knew 100% I was being scammed.

                I chanced upon this advertisement on slimming pants on facebook sometime in May and decided to place my order with the company – G&K BidBuy – SG. The company policy is to only collect cash payment upon receipt of the product and in any case of unsatisfactory product, they will do a refund within 7 days. 
On the day of delivery (26th May 2018), I was not at home and it was my hubby who opened the door and make payment of SGD 67 to the courier guy. However, when I reached home, I realized that wrong size was delivered to me so I immediately contacted the customer service personnel on the facebook. I was instructed to return the product to them which I did arrange for a courier service and I paid SGD 12 to deliver the product back to the return address (20 Jalan Kilang Barat Singapore 159363) on 28th May 2018. The said company promised to refund me my money within 7 to 20days.
To date, I have waited for more than 4 months but to no avail. The said company have been procrastinating and refused to do the refund. On certain days, they will say that refund have been made and asked me to check my account. However, when I check my bank transaction it was never there. When I do a follow up again they will say to send me another product which is of higher value, but I have refused to accept. 
They have blocked me on FB and refused to allow me to comment on their page so that they can continue to scam people!!!
They have created multiple account with the name of G&K. Hope no one will fall into their trap!

                I was approached by a student online claiming to be lacking of money. In exchange for money, she was willing to offer sex. I was alright with this arrangement initially as I was curious and I felt it was reasonable to help her out.

It happened on 5/10/2018 when we were supposed to meet at Ang Mo Kio MRT. A man called me on my phone number saying that he was the middleman and that he was there to ensure the safety of the girl. I ended up transferring up to $2600, with repeated excuses to top up.

Know this guy from CMB. He said that he's a Taiwanese & raised up in UK. 
He's very good with his words and quite a gentleman when chatting. Good command in English.. Too good to be true. He's just another scammer on CMB.  Ask for a loan, rejected him and he blocked me on everything.

Used both Google Image & TinEyes and his mobile number but couldn't find anything..

                On 12/09/2018, I ordered a Radiance A3 Smart watch online via an advertisement I saw on facebook.  I received the item on 18/09/2018 via Ninja Van logistics.  But I was surprise and shock that the item I ordered online is different from what I received.  Instead,  I received two pieces of cheapo CHINA watch.  So to all online buyers,  beware of this Radiance A3 Smartwatch they are selling online.  Always check if any scam alert for that item posted online before purchasing.  Thank you.

                Accepted his FB request because we had a mutual friend. Claimed to be a drilling engineer. Sending you parcel containing valuable gifts. And the courier company asked for SGD2900 of tax on these items. Subsequently informed that large amount of cash was discovered and required SGD10500 for cash declaration. Further requested for 6% duty tax on that huge amount to clear MY custom. Scammer tried to gain sympathy that his father passed away, all that amount was his life savings to fulfil last wish.

                When I purchased 3 bottles of Sterliplant 250ml bottle x 3. Having read their website I was sure this would be a beneficial product for my baby only to find the contents covered in mould and the liquid brown/yellow in colour. 

This company say they are legitimate sellers of a product which claims to be sterilised water. Yet what I got was totally shocking!

I went to see their factory as I was curious who these people really are. Their factory and place of business is build on a cesspool,the sanitation was totally disgusting.

These products are marketed for babies. They say on their label you can even “spray in the mouth” yet the place where they produce the product isn’t even fit for a farm animal to sleep in never mind for our children. 

THIS IS A WARNING DO NOT BUY IF YOU CARE ABOUT YOUR CHILDREN!

https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2018/07/31/sextortion-scam-with-hacked-passwords-scores-250000-dollars-for-cybercriminals/

I received this email today from [email protected]:

 I am aware   one of your pass. Lets get directly to the point. You do not know me and you're most likely wondering why you're getting this email? Absolutely no one has paid me to check about you. 

Well, I actually placed a malware on the X vids (sexually graphic) web-site and you know what, you visited this web site to have fun (you know what I mean). While you were watching video clips, your browser initiated functioning as a Remote control Desktop that has a keylogger which provided me with accessibility to your display screen and web camera. Right after that, my software gathered your entire contacts from your Messenger, Facebook, and email . And then I created a double video. 1st part shows the video you were viewing (you have a nice taste lol), and second part shows the recording of your webcam, & it is you. 

You got just two choices. We will check out each one of these options in details: 

Very first option is to ignore this e mail. In this instance, I will send out your recorded material to every bit of your personal contacts and visualize regarding the humiliation that you receive. And as a consequence in case you are in a relationship, exactly how this will affect? 

Other alternative should be to give me $1000. Let us call it a donation. Then, I will promptly delete your videotape. You will go forward your way of life like this never took place and you would never hear back again from me. 

You will make the payment through Bitcoin (if you don't know this, search for ""how to buy bitcoin"" in Google). 

BTC Address to send to: 12cfxh9t4Kmy9x5Mc7ide7v4nPu3DMwy44 
[case sensitive so copy and paste it] 

If you may be wondering about going to the cops, okay, this e mail cannot be traced back to me. I have dealt with my actions. I am not looking to charge you much, I just like to be rewarded. 

You have one day to pay. I've a special pixel in this message, and right now I know that you have read this mail. If I don't receive the BitCoins, I definitely will send your video to all of your contacts including members of your family, co-workers, etc. Nevertheless, if I do get paid, I will erase the recording right away. If you need evidence, reply with Yeah! then I will send your video recording to your 7 contacts. This is a non-negotiable offer that being said don't waste mine time and yours by replying to this message.

He asks for WhatsApp no. within minutes, said not convenient to use Facebook due to his line of work. And that he had to leave for flight to Canada soon and hope to be in touch with me via WhatsApp soon. I smell a scam unveiling. So reported this immediately.

Prerecorded voice in English and Chinese said “This is the Singapore High Court ...(unintelligible)...Press 9 for more information.” Pressed 9. Male picked up on the other line. I said “Is this the High Court?”. “Yes, what do you want?”. I said “I would like your money”. instantly the male at other end said in chinese “are you kidding?” I hung up. First of all, I have no record for infraction and secondly the High Court would contact me by registered mail. Scammer alert.

                I saw a rental advertisement on Ibilik.sg website two days ago. I emailed to Reverend Sim Yi Buang, the owner of a bedroom apartment that locates near to Lavender mrt station. Then, I was redirected to another email, who was told to be Reverend's wife, Rossana Buang. She requested a particularly clean person to take good care of her apartment. With a round of questionnaire via emails, we were made to believe that this couple wants someone who is very clean and look for someone who can take good care of the house. (LIAR!!!) After that, I was requested to pay deposit and two months’ rent, and so did I. However, things change in the evening! I was told that her husband accidentally took in another girl's deposit and she needed me to pay another 12 months’ rent to secure that room. Sensing something had gone wrong, I requested her to make a full refund on the payment made earlier. But now, she started to give me some weird reasons and became a bit off her track. She told me that her friend had transferred another 5k and I just needed 1k more to make her husband believed our sincerity. When I told that I was no longer interested in this, she didn't attempt to make any refunds, and closed the conversation. It is such a shameful renting experience and I start to have trust issue in online rental sites.

It is an automated voice message saying i have unpaid summons from Singapore's High Court.

The call was made on 27 August 2018 3.30 pm.

The automated voice message was of very high-quality, very authentic with an ""Official"" feel and in clear, properly-pronouced accentless English and mandarin Chinese.  It says I have a summon from Singapore's High Court.

Seriously don’t ever pick up calls that only tells you to press one digit for more info and that’s it.

Why would the bank be interested in my shipment and also the domain of email is not citi.

After which, he asked me to pray for him as he has signed for a contract for a company - and after which, he said he won the contract and would love to send me a gift to send thanks. 

The gift has a lot of luxury items and the courier person will contact you to ask for SGD2700 due to tax and overweighted parcel. DO NOT BELIEVE IN THIS SCAM. I have since blocked all contacts linking to this.

                I was on Tinder in Jan 2018 and I met this guy. He professed to fell in love after 2-3 weeks of chatting on WhatsApp and he deleted his tinder account quickly after he got my WhatsApp. He migrated to US when he was very young and is a loner. When he got overseas posting, he started telling stories which don’t tally and asked me to log into his banking account as he can’t do it where he was. It was weird and I confronted him. He flared up and blocked me on WhatsApp after that.

It is just so unfortunate. I am aware xxxxxx is your password. Moreover, I know your secret and I've evidence of this. You do not know me and no one paid me to investigate you. 

It's just your bad luck that I came across your bad deeds. Actually, I actually installed a malware on the adult vids (porn material) and you visited this web site to experience fun (you know what I mean). While you were watching videos, your browser initiated functioning as a Rdp (Remote desktop) with a keylogger which provided me access to your display screen and webcam. After that, my software obtained every one of your contacts from facebook, and e-mail. 

I then put in much more time than I should have exploring into your life and made a double display video. 1st part shows the video you were viewing and 2nd part displays the capture of your web cam (its you doing dirty things). 

Honestly, I am ready to forget details about you and allow you to get on with your daily life. And my goal is to give you 2 options that may accomplish this. The above options are to either ignore this letter, or simply pay me $ 2900. Let us explore these two options in more detail. 

Option One is to ignore this email. Let's see what is going to happen if you take this path. I will definitely send out your video to all of your contacts including relatives, colleagues, and so forth. It does not shield you from the humiliation your self will need to feel when relatives and buddies find out your dirty videos from me. 

Second Option is to send me $ 2900. We will name it my “privacy charges”. Now lets see what will happen if you opt this option. Your secret will remain your secret. I'll delete the recording immediately. You move on with your routine life like nothing like this ever happened. 

At this point you may be thinking, “I should call the cops”. Let me tell you, I have covered my steps to ensure that this email message can't be traced time for me plus it will not steer clear of the evidence from destroying your lifetime. I'm not trying to dig a hole in your pocket. I just want to be compensated for the time I placed into investigating you. Let's assume you decide to create all this disappear and pay me my confidentiality fee. You will make the payment through Bitcoin (if you do not know this, type ""how to buy bitcoins"" on google search) 

Transfer Amount: $ 2900 
Send To This Bitcoin Address: 19224kBa2V1PyPntEhiJmkBgh6RGyGH3Vj 
(It's CASE sensitive, so copy and paste it carefully) 

Expalin no one what you will be sending the Bitcoins for or they may not offer it to you. The task to get bitcoins usually takes a short time so do not procrastinate.
I've a specific pixel in this e-mail, and now I know that you've read this message. You have 24 hours to make the payment. If I do not receive the Bitcoin, I will certainly send your video recording to your contacts including friends and family, colleagues, and so forth. You better come up with an excuse for friends and family before they find out. Nonetheless, if I do get paid, I will destroy the proof immediately. It is a non-negotiable one time offer, so kindly do not ruin my time & yours. Your time is running out.

                We met on Plenty of Fish,  April 2018 it began and just came to a screeching end Monday July 9,2018.  I lost 150 in iTunes and approx. 1700 in cash, and the man I grew to care about and love in many ways. The red flags were there from the beginning but I ignored them. I even found myself thru the entire experience telling him that I new he was   a scam artist.  The emotional pain is worse then the money. He was thorough and good what he does.

                Chairman, Kenneth Kam, claims to be a great trader that can easily make 6-16% returns consistently every month without leverage. He has been getting investors to invest in him, promising 3% payout PER MONTH and Principal guaranteed. Sounds too good to be true. Till date, he is still paying his investors as his Ponzi scheme is only less than 1 year old. High possibility that investors will lose their money in a few months time as he is already on MAS watchlist.

                Met this guy on CMB in May 2018, said he's Canadian. After a week, proposed his love and promised to visit me here in SG. Sent me itinerary of his flight. 17-Jun, he called me using an unknown number, said he is being detained at Beijing's airport, let me speak to an officer and asked for 5k USD to release him. They seemed believable so I sent the money. Luckily, a friend told me of a similar story on the same day. I immediately withdrew all my funds so the transaction won't go through.

                Received a robocall today claiming to be from the Chinese Embassy. Was directed to a person speaking in Mandarin after pressing 1. Asked me for my Chinese name to check on some things which I gave. Told me that a credit card under my name is being linked to a Chinese man who is in a case of possessing a large number of credit cards. Hung up abruptly afterwards.

I am a bit concerned that I have given the person my Chinese name. Am I at risk of being scammed?

This is my second time received such a scam call, asking for NRIC. I was aware of such cases (thanks to this website) and as such I dropped the call immediately.

                Received a call at 8:39am. A 'Chinese embassy staff'  told me that a PRC lady was caught at Beijing Airport, with multiple credit cards, and one was under my name. The lady told the airport police that I sold her the credit card for S$2000 when she visited S'pore. The officer then transferred my call to the 'Beijing Interpol' for further investigation. I gave an excuse to hang up the call. Called the local Chinese Embassy to verify. No such officer and the embassy only operates from 9am!

                I have invested $49 (forty US dollars) with the https://moneyonlineinvestment.com by purchasing shares put on sale. In their website they assure that they will pay dividends for each share purchased. I have purchased shares such as Ethereum Farm (ETH), Legacinetworks (TLS), Coin Collector Bitcoin Generator (CCBG), Agropreneur Gogreen (AGG) and App Making Central (AMC) during the period of October 2017 and November 2017 using my PayPal account. In February 2018 I had accumulated a dividend balance of USD 25/- in my account so I requested a withdrawal to my PayPal account. However, upto today 28 May 2018 the USD 25/- was not transferred. I sent several emails to them via their contact us page, but they kept on saying that my request will be processed soon. I even contacted PayPal support services to get their assistance. But they told me that for this type of purchases, like buying shares there is no buyer’s protection. So I wrote to https://moneyonlineinvestment again and again but unfortunately my dividends still not received. I must mention here that I am receiving payments to my PayPal account from other sources. So there is no reason why https://moneyonlineinvestment.com cannot transfer payment to my PayPal account. Hence it is 100% confirmed https://moneyonlineinvestment.com is a SCAM WEBSITE. I have taken screen shots of my account page, My Shares page and all other pages to proof that I have invested with https://moneyonlineinvestment.com Hence, I caution all who have invested and those who are planning to invest with this website they are SCAM! Do not invest your hard earned money with this website and their associated websites such fast2earn.com, purchasesharesonline.com, etc.

This is the link to the scam currently taking place.

https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=1888528831439385&id=1792490614376541

The person is trying to sell an unrealistic device that claims to be able to receive tv signals for all kind of channels including paid ones, without wifi or anything. It is targetting fellow Singaporeans only.

Case will worsen with football season coming.

                I received a call on 20th May 2018 claiming to be from ICA and claimed that I have some immigration problem and need to key in my personal information.  Luckily I happened to read an scam alert article from scamalert.sg just few days before I receiving this call so I quickly hanged up the phone.
It was a recorded female voice speaking Chinese with very strong China accent.   The number displayed on my handphone is
+65 6797 1369.

                I bought a watch from Wowmall as advertised in Yahoo webpages. It is vastly different from the product that was shown on the web. When i wrote in to them to return the watch back, they totally ignored.
The differences as follows:-
1)      It is a quartz watch instead of an automatic mechanical watch.
2)      The wordings on the watch are “PINTIME, QUARTZ” instead of ""Luminor, GMT, or Ceramica"".
3)      The back of the watch is a piece of metal plate instead of a see through glass .
4) The Leather strip was also different.
It was totally different product from the web pages shown.

 I wanted to check the watch upon receiving it but the box was wrapped up and the delivery guy told me that he was just doing delivery only. So I accepted it but upon opening the box, I found that the watch is totally different from what your advertisment.
As per your advertisement, the product can be returned within 7 days for no reason.

Seems like this is done pretty massive, saw another guy reporting the same issue from a different number,  only the 4 last number of the scammer is the same. 

Hopefully Singapore Police would be able to track these kind of people, or put them in jail.

It was an automated voice recorded message and it was entirely in Mandarin. It mentioned “police”, one of the few words I understood.

I will like you to kindly transfer the mover agent fee today because payment must be confirmed before the pickup date. My items are expected to be picked up by 28th of April and i do not want to reschedule the date to avoid being charged more. 

Below are the details of my mover agent where the sum of $1,184 is to be sent because i sent the sum of $2,754 SGD to you in total. 

All you need to do is to go to the Western Union outlet with the cash, ask for money transfer form and then fill the form accordingly.

Name: Yunlong Gu

Address: Rm 1525, Golden Central Tower Building, No. 3037 Jintian Road, Futian District, Shenzhen China


Kindly get back to me with the transfer information i will forward it to the mover and let them know the transfer is being done by a friend on my behalf.

Tan

                I saw Prumio at Betalist, supposedly an AI that helps PR campaigns.  It happened on March.  After 1 week of contact with an account manager, there was no communication until the next debit in April.  I tried to follow up during March and April but there was no response from Account Manager Tom and even James Walsch from the Betalist account.  I lost USD$400.  Mailpad, salescamp, and growthstore are the same company.

I wanted to save the link, but there was a count down clock which triggered me to register with my gmail account.

After awhile, my phone rang with 2 overseas calls, which I did not pick up. I only picked up when a local number called in. The call was noisy at the background, the caller was hard to reject when I wanted to end the call. He called few more times and I never pick up.

                First, I received the promotion message from this mobividio. After I clicked their promotion link, I was automatically suscribed to their service. And I didn't aware that they were charging to my mobile bill 8dollars / week. It is unfair that by just clicking their promotion website and they automatically suscribed and charged me for nothing. Starhub should not allow this type of service to send message to its suscribers. Also, they should review the 3rd party bill collected to suscribers.

                A guy by the name of Seung So Jimmy found me through Paktor app.

From Paktor, we proceeded to chat and voice call in whatsapp for about 1 month.

He confessed he love me alot, keep checking up on me if i am ok and will worry if i never chat with him for awhile.

1 month later, he started to ask if if i can borrow him huge money like usd $4,500 which i did not. And his attitude towards our relationship became sour and foul when i say i could not help him. So be wary of him

I suspect the email is a scam because (1) I have not requested removal of my email address, (2) its email address is suspicious, and (3) the bad English in the email.

I tried to contact SingTel for verification, but gave up after being put on hold for more than 15 minutes.

                On 13th April 2018, I received an SMS from no. 70501 with the following message:
""You've been charged S$5.00/week (w/GST) to your Singtel Account for HaveFunVideos. Unsubscribe
here (http://hfa.mobi/id143612772) Hotline (6564437113)""
I was pretty tied up then & did not respond to it.
On 19th April 2018, I receive another SMS from no. 70501 with the following message:
""Your HaveFunVideos subscription will be renewed tomorrow for S$5.00/week (w/GST). Unsubscrive
here (http://hfa.mobi/id144184114) Hotline (6564437113). You will not be charged if PRS barring is
activated.
On both instances above, I did not activate any subscription and know of anyone who do. Also did not
consent to any subscription.
However, on calling Singtel at 1688 to verify, Ii was told that I was billed S$5 twice, first time on 13th April
and 2nd time on 19th April 2018.
Singtel made a check and confirm the company to be TMT Connekt, related to www.tmtconnekt.com.
I called TMT Connekt, at 64437113, to verify. They simply say there is no charges made to my phone bill
and will unsubscribe my phone to their service. But I have checked with Sintel and $10 had been
charged.
I would like to report this as a scam by TMT Connekt. They simply activated charges to my phone billing
without my consent and refuse to acknowledge they have made charges. They should be blacklisted and
not allowed to operate in Singapore. They should also subsequently refund any charges to my phone bill,

The last demand of money was to pay 35,000 to Mr Karl's boss which he said is legal. He will keep rushing you to pay money to get parcel. his contact no is 8279 9783.

                It was an unusual case that happened in Malaysia.  I have lost RM 30k to a phone scam due to the wrong advise or negligence from the police at SS17, Subang Jaya Police Station.  Addition to this, I suffered with miscarriage pain due to the emotional pain that I encountered from that incident.  How can I proceed to sue the police or the police station or the Malaysia government?  Your advise and assistance on this is highly appreciated.  Thank you.

Hi Chui Pheng,

Thanks for your interest. Rental is $650 all inclusive like wifi , electrical and water bills. Deposit one month ( non refundable if u later decide not to rent and back out ) plus one month advance. Hence when u confirm u want to rent u place 1 month $650 as deposit and when u move in on that day u then pay the 1 month advance $650. Attached few pictures taken at night for your room.

When u want to view the room ? It’s a nice and quite place to stay.







Just curious pls allow me to ask that since u are Singaporean. You do not have your own HDB flat or stay with parents ?

Regards,
Michael

And a person contacted me via email claiming that she is unable to view room as she works for US Coast Marine Detachment which is very strange. And she said due to her work she could not access to website and phone however able to check emails which is contradicting because she would not be able to see my ads as they are advertised on website.

                On my search for an outboard motor I was directed to this website http://www.onlineoutboardshop.com/ (A sponsored google site). The prices were incredible and the site looked highly professional with a compliance certificate and various appropriate content including Terms and Conditions/International Shipping, etc. I made an email inquiry into purchasing a motor and received an immediate response with requested information. After doing some research (obviously not enough - I should have checked phone numbers and used Google earth on the addresses)I decided to go ahead and purchase the outboard using their credit card cart system. I received an automated response stating ""Our bank merchant credit card company (MIDTRANS PAYMENT GATEWAY) unable to charge credit card at this time"". I contacted them again through email and was asked to use a bank transfer payment method which I was hesitant to use due to the high difficulty in receiving a refund if the transaction was fraudulent. I felt reasonably confident although hesitant, however, they offered a 15% discount which enticed me to go ahead. A bank transfer of $950US was made and an automated reply came stating that the outboard had been ordered. A further email came two days later offering a monthly promotion of a second motor for an extra $650US which made me awfully suspicious and declined their offer. Two more automated emails were received stating 'awaiting shipment' and finally 'shipped'. After a few days I sent an email inquiring about a tracking number that was supposed to be sent - no reply. I sent another two emails with no reply. I asked a friend to send them an email inquiring about purchasing an outboard to see if they were scamming me and sure enough they replied immediately telling him that they shipped from their warehouse and it would take 5 days to arrive. It has now been over two weeks with no contact or outboard and I attempted to contact them using their phone numbers with no success - they are not connected. I did a thorough Google earth search and it appears there is no Tradehub11 (building) in that area. I used a website www.scamadviser.com which gave me quite a deal of detail and it appears this site is a scam. I want this site closed down so no other fool is duped into throwing their money away. I thought I would test out the authenticity further and created a Hotmail account for my wife under a different name. She sent an email saying that their phones were not working and was interested in buying an outboard for her husband (me). He promptly replied with “the network may be down, contact me on +6283 1616 7 9695”. We tried the number with no luck and sent another email to which he requested my wife’s number and low and behold he actually rang. The conversation was extremely ‘dodgy’ and when my wife said that she had a friend in Singapore not far from their address who would pick up the item, he became rather flustered and we have not heard from him since!!!!

He said he owned a company. Worked as petrochemical engineer. He said he was from Singaporean but grew up in Philadelphia, USA. He said he was relocating back to Singapore and be with me. 

About one week into our correspondences, he told me he had financial difficulties. His machine broke down and he was stuck. Total money loss SGD45,000.

 2nd call on 26 Feb , again from MOM, this time with an Indian accent. Caller said i had entered  my date of birth in immigration form ( 1 year back ) in DDMM format instead of MMDD and i need to pay penalty to avoid deportation.

                On my search for an outboard motor I was directed to this website http://www.onlineoutboardshop.com/ (A sponsored google site). The prices were incredible and the site looked highly professional with a compliance certificate and various appropriate content including Terms and Conditions/International Shipping, etc. I made an email inquiry into purchasing a motor and received an immediate response with requested information. After doing some research (obviously not enough - I should have checked phone numbers and used Google earth on the addresses)I decided to go ahead and purchase the outboard using their credit card cart system. I received an automated response stating ""Our bank merchant credit card company (MIDTRANS PAYMENT GATEWAY) unable to charge credit card at this time"". I contacted them again through email and was asked to use a bank transfer payment method which I was hesitant to use due to the high difficulty in receiving a refund if the transaction was fraudulent. I felt reasonably confident although hesitant, however, they offered a 15% discount which enticed me to go ahead. A bank transfer of $950US was made and an automated reply came stating that the outboard had been ordered. A further email came two days later offering a monthly promotion of a second motor for an extra $650US which made me awfully suspicious and declined their offer. Two more automated emails were received stating 'awaiting shipment' and finally 'shipped'. After a few days I sent an email inquiring about a tracking number that was supposed to be sent - no reply. I sent another two emails with no reply. I asked a friend to send them an email inquiring about purchasing an outboard to see if they were scamming me and sure enough they replied immediately telling him that they shipped from their warehouse and it would take 5 days to arrive. It has now been over two weeks with no contact or outboard and I attempted to contact them using their phone numbers with no success - they are not connected. I did a thorough Google earth search and it appears there is no Tradehub11 (building) in that area. I used a website www.scamadviser.com which gave me quite a deal of detail and it appears this site is a scam. I want this site closed down so no other fool is duped into throwing their money away.

                Saw an ad on craigslist selling brand new macbook 2017 model for 1.7k, decided to contact the seller out of curiosity but already had a gut feeling that it was too good to be true. When contacted, he/she stated the best price was actually 1k, which was shocking as a new model usually costs 3k+ .

I decided to probe more, and he/she apparently said it was on promotion sales, and said that meetups are not possible and that i would have to do bank transfer. 

After googling i realised it was a scam

That person texted me via Facebook Messenger to borrow my handphone number as an account for submission to a lucky draw.

I have just received a call from 63368111 at 10.12am today, from a man with a Filipino accent telling me that there is discrepency with my income tax filing, since 2010, and that I owed over $4000 in tax arrears. He said if this matter goes to court, all my assets will be freezed and if I have overseas assets, my citizenship will be revoked.

My immediate response to him is that if such actions will be taken on me for a mere $4000 arrear, this is obviously a scam and that I will report this matter to the police and IRAS. I then hanged up. 

I will report this matter. A caution to all not to be deceived by such tactics.

                Hi,I was scammed 3 years ago and after confronting the scammer and he denied, I decided to stay in it and use him back to get more info, to strengthen my boundaries and change within. I really got a Wake-up call with the scamstory which is now a novel with authentic material(written with Eva Alderborn) that has helped many victims to both recognize themselves and to not feel alone.
Scam Story can be purchased at Amazon, Barnes and Noble. ISBN 978-1-78222-566-9. Hopefully it will help many more.

                Thank God i didn't loose anything, but this scammer called on skype from sweden and was a female with good Swedish English accent, sent her pics which were fake (adult star photos). This girl didn't ask for money or my pics and talked for over month, had good music choice plus discussed movies and TV shows. When confronted about her Fake Pics and to video chat she blocked me. surely be careful scammers have evolved to have better accents and life choices that you could fall pray for.  Take care.

                Basically this company is sending renewal notices for owners of domain names - telling them that their URL has expired and for them to immediately renew their domain names.

Because I keep records of all of the domain names I own I knew something was wrong.

However my client thought that he had to renew his domain and was about ready to pay for it.

I wanted others should be aware of this scam.

                On 16 Dec 2017 a scammer wants my number for contact purposes & asked me for whatsapp pass codes for 5 times. When i gave her,she asked me not to worry as it will charged to her phone bill. 
Ended up it was a disaster & I reported to the Police on 23 Dec 2017 when my bill exploded. Starhub & 3rd party providers are unable to help me with this issue. By right whatsapp will never ask for the pass codes, regardless whether your phone or number changed.

- New online account to sell things, selling the first item, price way below market price.
- If we can get their bank account, and hp number, why can't police authority do a ""quick check"", and investigate them if hp is reported stolen, or bank account looks dubious? 
- Police allowed to contact Telco, and track them down using GPS?

If this is possible, think the number of scam case in Singapor will drop a lot, after letting everyone know that fact.

                I was applying for a visa on behalf of a friend from China since they cannot apply themselves online. I struggled with the portal due to firstly alot navigation and software bugs. when I tried to apply using my singpass I noticed the site keeps hanging. Many bugs and functionality issues. I doubled check and refreshed the page many times to make sure a correct submission was made. I also made several complaints to ICA about the problems throughout my application. To my surprise, ICA responded after several days that the visa application was rejected due to an extra spacing in the name. 

 I followed the instructions and repeated the submission, they requested the documents alot of documents and drag the entire process to 2 weeks instead of 3 days, stated on their website.l
 Later, after that I noticed later that ICA deducted from my debit card 150 dollars instead of 90 dollars for 3 successful applications. I was not informed about the extra deduction and checked the ICA website which has no  indication that ICA has the right to deduct money for rejected applications.  Even so this is a matter that required fair explanation due to the unjust circumstances and credibility of ICA.  When I contacted ICA through govtech facebook page，ICA insists that it has the right to deduct the money without further explanation and did not even apologise for the inconvenience caused.
 I emailed and called ICA several times but they did not respond after 1 or 2 correspondences. The service and the experience was abject. Staff was rude with an avoidance and responsibility pushing attitude. 

When I called, staff insist they didn't know know how to reach the right department and I should only email instead. Sometimes staff even raised their voice at me when they find I give them too much detail. Similar bad experiences can be seen in the various bad reviews of ICA across many forums and social media by other netizens.  I hope ICA will explain why my $60 is deducted unfairly from me without my knowledge and apologise to me for inconvenience caused during my visa application. I also expect a full refund of the extra money deducted from me. I have occasionally been forwarding emails and calling ICA for the last 3 months with no response. I sent about 20 emails to ICA. No response. ICA  just dodged the issue completely and hinted me that there is no chance for reparation. 

 I brought the issue to reach.gov.sg less than 1 week ago, Reach promised to resolve this issue. Finally an anynoymous staff ICA responded that they have made a police report that I emailed their staff and described their customer service as trash and described my situation as a scam. Until now there is no response regarding my complaint over the over deduction. This has lasted over 3 months.

                The company offered me to work as a writer for MStars, which I later was transferred to its affiliate site KPopStarz). For the first three months, the payment was okay. Come May, they started showing a hint that something was wrong with the company. So the writers' salary for the month was never paid up until now. They never pay up my salary (about USD 400). The director said they will clear all dues by the end of the year, but until now nothing come up yet. Please be aware!

                The 7th of December they came home for tv repair.  The following message was sent to them afterwards with no response so far no answer. Nothing. Just silence.

Let me tell you my wife's experience with your Chinese guy. He did not want to give receipt only to take the tv. He pretended to make 2 phone calls which he didn't (he was PRETENDING to talk by phone) only to say that more things needs to be changed on my tv.... perhaps.... Not sure... He did not provide name of your company or address or card or any identification despite being requested.... He said that he would take the tv but he couldn't confirm when he would bring it back. Not even an approximate estimation.... With all this my wife decided not to let go the tv. Obviously. So, does this guy work for you? Is he a partner? Are you the owner? Is your company a scum? Are you and all of you as reliable as this Chinese guy? Do you survive by cheating? Cause i am seriously thinking in reporting you.... And finally, you own me 30 dollars, because this was a joke. A very bad joke. Not funny.

                - Booked for a rental car in australia and paid through the website.
- All seemed in order and info on the site stated that there were no extra charges.
- Upon arrival at the airport, there was no booking with the car company and they were not contactable. 
- Went to the car rental company outlet and i had to pay full price again for the car.

                A guy wanted to buy my iPhone X, asked for my details such as address, name and account number. After given all the details, he attached a receipt of the transaction but no amount was transferred. As I was reluctant to proceed with the handing over of the iPhone X, he threatened me. I got scared and handed over. I called UPS to stop the shipment but he then called back UPS and used my name to tell them to proceed. The iPhone is then sent to Selangor. UPS owe me an explanation on this matter.

But I did received a call pretending to be from CitiBank from ‭6636 2324‬. The Filipino lady on the line asking for my NRIC etc. I refused, and told her I didn’t know if she is really from Bank. She insisted and threatening the Fee will not be waived. I disconnected. Citibank should look into that, as there is a Leak in their Call Centre.

That is when I verified that such job offer is unregistered and informed me that it might be a scam. Further check to the information provided by the scammer shows inconsistent contact information to the real Minshall Contruction Firm in UK. Further research over the internet about the scammer lead me to this website: https://419advancefeefraud.blogspot.com/2017/11/careersminshallconstructioneuropecom.html
 which enlightened me very well.
       Luckily enough, I did not pay the money they are asking. But my real concern, is the possible use of my precious information/Identity which might be used for a scam or any crime related to money laundering or sort of that. I’d submitted to them the copy of my PRC ID which can be used for opening unauthorized credit card account or bank loan.
   These are the people I’d made transaction

                got an email from Tan Mui Joo that she needs a room. I should have guessed that something is fishy when she did not negotiate the rental with me and wanted only myPaypal account so that she could transfer money to me to secure the room.She also requested for the rented unit address so that she could ship her belongings over. 

I sent her a copy of a TA (watermarked sample) that has the to-be-rented address & NRIC , but I did not provide her any Paypal account.Will she ship illegal stuff to me?

Then she asked me to wire RM1,000.00.. it seemed fishy to me, so i checked the internet and viola! i have the same experience with a few others.
""Thanks for getting back to me. I am Li XiaoJie, 35 years old, a simple, cool and non-smoker lady. I am willing to rent the unit as I am at sea at the moment as i am an employee at US Coast Guard Marine Inspection Detachment Malaysia,

I ordered 2 torch lights, paid by credit card online.

More than a month later, no torchlights were received, no refunds were made.

He did send a photo of a successful transfer. But, did not see this in my account. After i told him that there is no transaction has been made. He threatened me “i have all your details”

It happened at Buona Vista near to MRT area. Uncle pleaded in sympathy that he do not have his mobile and wallet with him because he just got discharged. Hosp couldn’t contact his daughter and so he had to figure his own own to go back home. It did not happen just once because as I was sharing on my social media, a friend messaged and said she met the same uncle 2 weeks ago.

At first, the screen said US$18.00, I was keen to give it a try coz it seemed rather affordable. But when my credit card bill came, i got a rude shock, I was charged US$180.00. That was truly very scary. If I knew it was US180, I won't have bought it in the first place.

                I had a number of missed calls from Hong Kong to my Malaysia mobile in May, June & Aug. I didn't answer or return the calls as i remember some months back (on 22 Feb from 85230697016), a lady who i can tell from her accent is a Chinese nationality called me from Hong Kong and invited me to an event in Kuala Lumpur. I told her that time that i won't attend and she said if i really can't, then just watch the live telecast from TV. However, there were so many calls made to me in Aug that finally i decided to answer it. 
When i finally answered the call on 6 Sep from 85230506853, a China lady called Yang Zhi Xuan (my own translation), informed me that i have won a prize in their KL event in March which i didn't attend. Said i was the only person who has not collected the prize. Said they tried to call me many times to tell me about the winning and how i can collect it. She told me that i can go to their office on HK to collect the prize. I told them it's impossible for me to go to HK to collect the prize and that it's fine for me to just forgo it. However the lady was rather persistent and said that i was the 3rd prize winner with a good prize money. She said that i can choose a 2nd option by selling the prize back to the manufacturer at 20% less the value. She gave me their website to verify that i was the winner. Their website is www.tenlong.hk. On 8 Sep, Ms Yang from 85230506853 called me again. She asked if i have decided on how i want to redeem the prize. Also asked if i've checked their website. When i told her that i can't see that i was the winner from their website, she directed me to a login page and gave me the and 。is the last 6 digit of my mobile and the password was few digit numbers given by her.  I saw my name as the 3rd winner with a prize of a diamond set with 4 items (bracelet, necklace, ear rings and ring). The winning seems very real and i told her that i'll go for the 2nd option to redeem the prize. On 11 Sep, i received a call from 85230697385 from  (translated as Zhang Zhen Ping). She verified and confirmed with me that i'll go for the 2nd option to redeem the prize. She said that i'll need to pay 15% tax to Malaysia government before i can redeem the prize. This has to be done immediately before they can process my documents for taxation and for the bank to transfer the prize money to me. I told her that i will not be able to pay the tax immediately as i'm working in Spore. Ms Zhang then told me that they can get a local agent in Malaysia to help me pay tax. They will return the fee to me after i've redeemed the prize. The next person who called me was (translated as Ma Zheng Xiong. He is known as  (General Ma). He confirmed that he has received documentation to process my prize money of RM269466. In order for them to process this prize, i'll have to pay an immediate tax to the Malaysia government. Asked me to check with Ms Zhang on the procedure. After the conversation with Ms Zhang and Mr Ma, i was rather convinced about the prize. So i went ahead to transfer RM8083 to Lee Soon Leng of Maybank account 112138163556. When i've done the transfer, Mr Ma called me and said that he has received the official document to submit my application to redeem the prize. He asked me for my membership number. When i told him that i don't have my membership number, he was puzzled as to why i don't know my membership number as all winners have to their members. I told Ms Zhang about this and asked her for my membership number. She checked and was puzzled too that i wasn't their member. I told her i'm indeed not their member. I even questioned them on why they still want to give me the prize if i'm not their member in the first place. She said that at the end of the event in Kuala Lumpur, they have announced to all winners that if they're not their member, they can register at the counter immediately to get their membership. She even said that though i was not at the event, they also telecast on TV to tell the other winners on how they can call them to register their membership. Said i was so careless of not following the instruction. Ms Zhang asked me to tell Mr Ma sincerely that i've misplaced my membership card. She reminded me not to tell Mr Ma that i'm not their member but to sincerely appeal to him for help to still process the documentation to redeem the prize. So i called Mr Ma to tell him that i've misplaced my membership card. He said why i was so careless and said that he cannot promise he can help but he'll report to their BOD (Board of Directors). In the next one hour, Mr Ma called me and said that the prize is only meant for members. He gave me the option to become their lifetime membership at HK$20K. I told him there's no way i'll pay that money and i'll just forgo the prize. He agreed that the lifetime membership is expensive and gave me an option of a temporary membership just for the purpose of this prize redemption. Said i'll need to pay for this temporary membership and that they'll return the amount to me once i've redeemed the prize. He also mentioned that their BOD felt bad on the delay of my prize redemption. As they have a major investment project on investment stock index futures of the French CAC later in the evening, he said if they make some money, they'll give me some bonus from that but there's no guarantee. So at the end on the same day of 11 Sep, i made another TT transaction of RM10747 for the membership payable to Chong Wei Quan of Maybank account 152031697386. The next day on 12 Sep, i received message from Ms Zhang that my membership is done. I was given my membership number as BK35071860. I gave my membership number to Mr Ma. He said he'll process the document immediately. As they're very busy now with the big investment event, they may not be able to remit the money to me on the same day. Also mentioned that they'll help me pay 19% tax to Hong Kong government. On 13 Sep, Mr Ma said the invesment event last night was very successful. Due to the delay in remitting the prize money to me, their BOD is happy to give me additional bonus on top of my orize money. Said i'll get a total of RM412800. Since the prize þ is so huge, he asked me for another bank account. I gave my OCBC Bank details. Later on the same day, i received call from 85251277336 and 85269919809. She said she's Ms Chen of HSBC Bank. Said they've received my documents. However in order for them to transfer RM412800 to both my Maybank and OCBC Banks, i need to pay tax to Hong Kong government for overseas remittance to prevent money laundering. I'll have to pay the amount before they can make the transfer to overseas account. The next day on 14 Sep, i made a transfer of RM49536 to Peh Tian Leong of CIMB Bank account 7066806108. I received calls from Mr Ma and Ms Chen of HSBC Bank later to assure me that the payment is final and that i'll see the prize money in my bank account by tomorrow. The next conversation i had with them was something i could not remember the exact details but was also my biggest and final money lost to them. I was asked to make another transfer of RM80000. I remember it was 5% of the total prize money of RM4128000. So the next day on 15 Sep, i made a transfer of RM80000 to Peh Tian Leong of CIMB Bank account 7066806108. On the very day 18 Sep where i was promised that i'll see the prize money of RM4128000, i received a call slightly after 9 in the morning from a man who claimed that he's from Hong Kong taxation authority. He said he just wanted to verify if i'm expecting some big remittance. He asked me if it was for an investment purpose and asked what investment was that for and the total money that i've invested. I didn't know what to say as i didn't expect this call at all. So i told him it's investment of jewellery and asked him to talk to Tenlong company. He then sounded very authoritative and said that there's problem with the document. He also asked if i'll pay the tax as an individual or through Tenlong company. After that call, i talked with Mr Ma about the call with the taxation authority. He said i shouldn't have said it's for investment purpose. Because of that, it has raised suspicion of the authority that they're coming to their office to check their documents. He said in the past they never had this issue before. They have no problem in processing the winnings for other winners. After Mr Ma made the call to the authority, he told me that as i've told the authority that i'll pay the tax as an individual and not from the company, they cannot help me to pay the difference of 4% tax which is equivalent to RM165120. He asked me to settle the amount by 21 Sep. I told him that i don't have that money. Then he asked me the maximum amount that i can pay. Asked me to find ways to get the balance amount. He also offered to lend me his personal money of HK$90K. I told my husband that night about the whole saga of 2 weeks and immediately he said i've fallen into a scam. I realised that this was the biggest mistake of my life that has made me lost a total of RM147366, or equivalent to S$48,243.81.

edited paper. Gave him my account no. and after he knows that his cover is blown, keeps threatening saying... I have your personal details. BEWARE.....

After transaction done, seller request additional deposit to be transferred for custom clearance and delivery person will refund in cash. I requested refund $300 to end this trouble purchase, but seller refuse and insist to have my NRIC picture for refund. The NRIC he sent over, could be his previous victim.

In the 4 numbers they have digits 0 to 9.That give them a better chance to edit the ticket and publish in facebook. Cos I saw my ticket first number changed.

                I had a number of missed calls from Hong Kong to my Malaysia mobile in May, June & Aug. I didn't answer or return the calls as i remember some months back (on 22 Feb from 85230697016), a lady who i can tell from her accent is a Chinese nationality called me from Hong Kong and invited me to an event in Kuala Lumpur. I told her that time that i won't attend and she said if i really can't, then just watch the live telecast from TV. However, there were so many calls made to me in Aug that finally i decided to answer it. 
When i finally answered the call on 6 Sep from 85230506853, a China lady called Yang Zhi Xuan (my own translation), informed me that i have won a prize in their KL event in March which i didn't attend. Said i was the only person who has not collected the prize. Said they tried to call me many times to tell me about the winning and how i can collect it. She told me that i can go to their office on HK to collect the prize. I told them it's impossible for me to go to HK to collect the prize and that it's fine for me to just forgo it. However the lady was rather persistent and said that i was the 3rd prize winner with a good prize money. She said that i can choose a 2nd option by selling the prize back to the manufacturer at 20% less the value. She gave me their website to verify that i was the winner. Their website is www.tenlong.hk. On 8 Sep, Ms Yang from 85230506853 called me again. She asked if i have decided on how i want to redeem the prize. Also asked if i've checked their website. When i told her that i can't see that i was the winner from their website, she directed me to a login page and gave me the and 。is the last 6 digit of my mobile and the password was few digit numbers given by her.  I saw my name as the 3rd winner with a prize of a diamond set with 4 items (bracelet, necklace, ear rings and ring). The winning seems very real and i told her that i'll go for the 2nd option to redeem the prize. On 11 Sep, i received a call from 85230697385 from  (translated as Zhang Zhen Ping). She verified and confirmed with me that i'll go for the 2nd option to redeem the prize. She said that i'll need to pay 15% tax to Malaysia government before i can redeem the prize. This has to be done immediately before they can process my documents for taxation and for the bank to transfer the prize money to me. I told her that i will not be able to pay the tax immediately as i'm working in Spore. Ms Zhang then told me that they can get a local agent in Malaysia to help me pay tax. They will return the fee to me after i've redeemed the prize. The next person who called me was (translated as Ma Zheng Xiong. He is known as  (General Ma). He confirmed that he has received documentation to process my prize money of RM269466. In order for them to process this prize, i'll have to pay an immediate tax to the Malaysia government. Asked me to check with Ms Zhang on the procedure. After the conversation with Ms Zhang and Mr Ma, i was rather convinced about the prize. So i went ahead to transfer RM8083 to Lee Soon Leng of Maybank account 112138163556. When i've done the transfer, Mr Ma called me and said that he has received the official document to submit my application to redeem the prize. He asked me for my membership number. When i told him that i don't have my membership number, he was puzzled as to why i don't know my membership number as all winners have to their members. I told Ms Zhang about this and asked her for my membership number. She checked and was puzzled too that i wasn't their member. I told her i'm indeed not their member. I even questioned them on why they still want to give me the prize if i'm not their member in the first place. She said that at the end of the event in Kuala Lumpur, they have announced to all winners that if they're not their member, they can register at the counter immediately to get their membership. She even said that though i was not at the event, they also telecast on TV to tell the other winners on how they can call them to register their membership. Said i was so careless of not following the instruction. Ms Zhang asked me to tell Mr Ma sincerely that i've misplaced my membership card. She reminded me not to tell Mr Ma that i'm not their member but to sincerely appeal to him for help to still process the documentation to redeem the prize. So i called Mr Ma to tell him that i've misplaced my membership card. He said why i was so careless and said that he cannot promise he can help but he'll report to their BOD (Board of Directors). In the next one hour, Mr Ma called me and said that the prize is only meant for members. He gave me the option to become their lifetime membership at HK$20K. I told him there's no way i'll pay that money and i'll just forgo the prize. He agreed that the lifetime membership is expensive and gave me an option of a temporary membership just for the purpose of this prize redemption. Said i'll need to pay for this temporary membership and that they'll return the amount to me once i've redeemed the prize. He also mentioned that their BOD felt bad on the delay of my prize redemption. As they have a major investment project on investment stock index futures of the French CAC later in the evening, he said if they make some money, they'll give me some bonus from that but there's no guarantee. So at the end on the same day of 11 Sep, i made another TT transaction of RM10747 for the membership payable to Chong Wei Quan of Maybank account 152031697386. The next day on 12 Sep, i received message from Ms Zhang that my membership is done. I was given my membership number as BK35071860. I gave my membership number to Mr Ma. He said he'll process the document immediately. As they're very busy now with the big investment event, they may not be able to remit the money to me on the same day. Also mentioned that they'll help me pay 19% tax to Hong Kong government. On 13 Sep, Mr Ma said the invesment event last night was very successful. Due to the delay in remitting the prize money to me, their BOD is happy to give me additional bonus on top of my orize money. Said i'll get a total of RM412800. Since the prize þ is so huge, he asked me for another bank account. I gave my OCBC Bank details. Later on the same day, i received call from 85251277336 and 85269919809. She said she's Ms Chen of HSBC Bank. Said they've received my documents. However in order for them to transfer RM412800 to both my Maybank and OCBC Banks, i need to pay tax to Hong Kong government for overseas remittance to prevent money laundering. I'll have to pay the amount before they can make the transfer to overseas account. The next day on 14 Sep, i made a transfer of RM49536 to Peh Tian Leong of CIMB Bank account 7066806108. I received calls from Mr Ma and Ms Chen of HSBC Bank later to assure me that the payment is final and that i'll see the prize money in my bank account by tomorrow. The next conversation i had with them was something i could not remember the exact details but was also my biggest and final money lost to them. I was asked to make another transfer of RM80000. I remember it was 5% of the total prize money of RM4128000. So the next day on 15 Sep, i made a transfer of RM80000 to Peh Tian Leong of CIMB Bank account 7066806108. On the very day 18 Sep where i was promised that i'll see the prize money of RM4128000, i received a call slightly after 9 in the morning from a man who claimed that he's from Hong Kong taxation authority. He said he just wanted to verify if i'm expecting some big remittance. He asked me if it was for an investment purpose and asked what investment was that for and the total money that i've invested. I didn't know what to say as i didn't expect this call at all. So i told him it's investment of jewellery and asked him to talk to Tenlong company. He then sounded very authoritative and said that there's problem with the document. He also asked if i'll pay the tax as an individual or through Tenlong company. After that call, i talked with Mr Ma about the call with the taxation authority. He said i shouldn't have said it's for investment purpose. Because of that, it has raised suspicion of the authority that they're coming to their office to check their documents. He said in the past they never had this issue before. They have no problem in processing the winnings for other winners. After Mr Ma made the call to the authority, he told me that as i've told the authority that i'll pay the tax as an individual and not from the company, they cannot help me to pay the difference of 4% tax which is equivalent to RM165120. He asked me to settle the amount by 21 Sep. I told him that i don't have that money. Then he asked me the maximum amount that i can pay. Asked me to find ways to get the balance amount. He also offered to lend me his personal money of HK$90K. I told my husband that night about the whole saga of 2 weeks and immediately he said i've fallen into a scam. I realised that this was the biggest mistake of my life that has made me lost a total of RM147366, or equivalent to S$48,243.81

Never register your credit cards with them!

From Mandy Tay (Singapore)

I am a victim of a uber scam & want to share my experience so others needn't fall prey.  I received a notification for a booking that I did not make & that the uber driver is on the way to pick me.  I contacted the only tel no. available on Uber website.  The customer service told me that she can't assist & that I have to e-mail them.  Told her her that by the time I e-mail & for them to react, that ride would have ended & I can't access my uber account.  She insisted the only option is to write in.  I e-mailed Uber immedietaly & they replied 2 hours later asking for verification which I sent immediately.  I did not receive anymore rides alert but 5 days later I realised a total of $2,100+ was charged to my card & all the rides were from UK.  Some costing as much as SG$578/trip.  I called the bank to cease my card & went to the police station to file a report & they advised me to notify Uber.  As there is no hotline for riders, the customer service instructed me to go to their main branch.  Upon arrival, the staff said there was nothing they could do as they only handle drivers & all the transactions were not in SG.  I was furious as I perceived Uber as a whole, regardless, whether  I was a driver, rider or if the transactions were incurred overseas & why the customer service told me to go to their office if they can't assist.  Was told by both the uber staff & the police that there were already several cases reported & some of the cases exceeded $10,000.  So my friends, take my case as a lesson learnt & don't be the next victim.

                I came across this adv on fb. 
It was for GoPro and it was rather cheap so I was like hey maybe this is like those outlet on line shops, so I wanted to give it a try.
I checked out and after filling the informations, and ordering it. They didn't bring me to safe check out for credit card site. 
I lost $49.90. I m not worried about the money, I was more worried for other falling in to this problem. 
Much to my dismay, a few others fell victim to it even after me posting on fb numerous of times.

Incase you're planning to hire maid from Manjit Kaur SG (+6590966735) then please beware. Her maids are medically unfit. They harrass employers for money. Plus Manjit will take advance on maid salary/ ticket & never refund.

She made false promises and never fulfilled them. Once her work is done she ignores calls and messages and will not take ownership for her lies. When threatened that a police complaint will be filed against her she was blatantly ""OKAY"" with it. In her own words, ""okay, go ahead"" was her response. This speaks volumes about her.

I had a terrible experience with her.

This is to alert members of this group to safegaurd themselves from such swindlers.

                I met this person through Skout. We started chatting and exchanged mobile numbers.Everything seems OK at first and he says he loves me and all.

He wanted to come here and he says he wasn't able to access his account,silly me gradually lent him $3k believing that he will pay back when he's here. After awhile he become more demanding and his words seems not to match up with whatever reasons he gave. I decided to end the relationship and he threatened me. I chose to not heed into his threats.

From 26 Jun to 7 Sept, we chatted everyday but he insisted phone cam was spoilt. He was very consistent and had good English.  

He closed biz deal and even sent me signed contracts and e-tickets for his biz travels and to Singapore. He eventually asked for USD$9K to help urgent biz deal as he miscalculated currency exchange.

Early declarations of love, always their first time on dating apps, telling you that they are a one man woman and is looking for a serious relationship at the beginning of your chats, always travelling , normally have 2 first names as their names, hesitant to meet. Research the information they put in their profiles; cross check things they tell you - check their Facebook profiles AND if it all sounds like too good to be true, it probably is..

                I would like to share a horrible experience I am going through right now. Last year a ""friend"" of mine by the name of David came up to me and asked me to invest into a company called Ram Brothers Construction. 
I was told to put my funds (45k) in and within 6 months my full principle together with 10% per month will be guaranteed returned back.
Today it's already been 20 months and I have still not received my principle or any of the bonuses that was ever promised. The money I put it was the hard earned money I got working out at sea. It was from sweat, oil and dirt and it never came easy.
Today everything in my life is a delay. The best part is that David had confidently said that if something ""screws up"" he'll pay me back from his own pocket. Today, not a single cent from him and he's gone all silent. (Which is also why I've decided to cut him off) I believe he was part of this from the start. (If he was a runner or not, I don't know). Everytime I ask him, ""I'm doing my best"" this is all I've been hearing for month after month. All I see is rubbish text messages up and down. According to him, ""others"" have invested with this person/company. But til today I have not seen one of the other ""investors"".
So pls, if anyone approaches you with the name of K.S Risvina or also known as B.Gayathri, Pls DO NOT entertain her or this David. DO NOT believe in her company Ram Brothers Construction. She is a Fraud, her company is one and sadly I have been conned. By both her and at that point my so called ""friend"".
Now I have gone to the Lawyers and very soon I'm going public with this. I want to warn others not to make the same mistake as me. In life nothing comes easy. Especially money. The only way achieving it is through hard work and sweat. 
If you have been faced with the same issue and have any queries pls PM me. This issue has been brought up to the national crime prevention board and KS Risvina and her company Ram Brothers Construction reported as a scam.

                I was introduced to an investment scheme which claims to use the money to invest in restaurants located in Malaysia. They had pictures of the restaurants and there are many other investors who said they have been to the restaurants themselves. 

The payout continues for a month then stopped totally. I lost about $10,964. To read the full story, please visit this link: https://gogetfunding.com/losing-faith-finding-hope/

1. Seller told to contact only through WhatsApp 
2. Wanted online transfer of 50% deposit 
3. No company of that name exists 
4. Offer not available at physical shop 
5. Can't meet at seller's place, must delivery to mine

Since we are under deep trouble and need to really look a place to stay ASAP, we decided to just refund the deposit.

                Chat on Facebook, talked about dead wife and daughter. 
One day, talked about sending presents to you that cost at least $50k, including branded goods, macbook pro and lots of stuff.

2 days later, he call to say that the items are held back at Malaysia customs and we need to pay money to release things. Out of trust I transferred $2k and customer request for more money. And I found it fishy and called the SG customs to confirm and they alerted me of such spam cases.

                I was desperately looking for a discontinued wetsuit and chanced upon this website. Made payment SGD 184.33 and realized it was deducted in RMB. Called the bank to hold payment but bank said it was my fault so they can't do anything. I was still hopping I might get left overs from China Factory (wetsuit company dissolved but factory is in China). Big mistake. The fraud site sent me a cheap Lycra Kids Size Wetsuit which cost less than 50 RMB. Bang my head and swore to be more careful next time.

Just sharing these 2 numbers that I've received on my office line.

China scammers obviously pretending to be Singapore HQ. While the new generation may be be vigilant enough to notice that it is a scam. The older generation might still fall for this old trick.

They may have plenty of back up numbers to assist them with the scams but just wanted to alert you the numbers I was contacted by so that others may not fall for it or best still if you are able to reverse trace it.

Thanks.

So a little intro on this guy,  I met this guy,  Tyler, on carousel to get some info on doing ubereats( because I was looking for fast cash) and somehow or rather he persuaded me to meet on this day to talk about some other fast cash methods. So me being ignorant, agreed to meet him and then he said to sell him my extra phone line which he would give me a certain amount of cash and $100 every month. So I blindly agreed to the deal and lend him $1.7k for some transaction issue and he promised to return within a day. But this guy keeps on delaying on returning the money until now still keep on giving excuses on returning the money. I know there's a slim chance that I would not be getting back the money.

                The incident happened in 2015. I was asked to join the MLM company and I was told  I could earn $500/week to do admin work. However, upon arriving at the location, the sales manager  asked me to  sell their expensive products to my family members.  The products were $3000 but my parents were skeptical about it hence, they paid $300 instead. Initially, we tried to reject their products but they were very pushy in selling. The company used to be Premier Pure and it has changed to BioGlobe.

Hi Sir/Madam,

I bought USS E-tickets worth $180 from a seller on 17 June 2017 and transferred the fund via fast funds transfer to his POSB Savings Account,when we went to USS last Saturday on 24 June 2017 and found that were used edited tickets. 

I hope the police can find out who the scammer is to stop him/her from doing fraud. i am hoping to get back my money as well.

Thanks & Regards

I am very grateful to the Singapore Consulate General in Dubai who have given me the link to contact your goodselves.

The below mentioned company is assisting fraud companies in Dubai to set up companies in Singapore

Innocent employees documents are used as Directors and once the company is set up their names are removed.

We are forced to sign dues settlement documents as you can see the documents are dated 17 June 17, i.e.after the complaint was lodged with the Singapore Consulate in Dubai.

The proper steps should have been Termination/Resignation document to be signed by the Director which was never done and the above company removed the name without these documents.

Looking for urgent action to be taken against these two companies.

                An unidentified number called me at my mobile at 2.16pm on 20th June 2017, the number displayed was +6566640416.  An operator spoke in Mandarin that there is a parcel/document for me at high court and today is the last day for collection. I was asked to press ""2"" for Chinese. I subsequently ended the call without following the operator's instructions because there was no other option and it feels suspicious to me. I used a desk phone to call the number but no one answered.

                On 9 June 2017, my mum said someone from police headquarters called her at 11.23am at her mobile number . Call lasted about 6min.

At first, a lady called, spoke in English and said she is calling from police HQ. Then a man took over and asked my Mum in Chinese, if someone just called police HQ, and he is calling  back now.

He asked for my mum's name. My mum provided. Then he asked for my mum NRIC number. My mum refused, and he repeatedly ask my mum to bring her IC and go to police HQ.

                I book my tickets online and fly 3 - 4 times a year with the same airline ( Tiger Air ) for 8 years.

I make 1 mistake in the spelling of my name and don't notice the mistake until after the online booking is complete.

When i checkin to get my boarding pass, i am told to buy another ticket because the booking name doesn't exactly match the name on my passport.

So i am forced to pay for 2 seats but can only use 1 and the airline now sells my other seat to someone else.

I have not gained any advantage and the airline has not lost out however the fact is the airline has gained and i have lost out.

In this case the airline gains the full price of the ticket as 100% profit plus the profit they make on the new ticket.

Its immoral, opportunistic and should be illegal to exploit errors in booking names yet airlines are making billions from it.

Here's the proof : United Airlines collected $243 million in name change fees during the first three quarters of 2010, and domestic airlines in the U.S as a whole collected $1.7 billion.

If the bank accidentally transfers money into my account and i accidentally spend some of it, i can be charged with a criminal offense. 

If i don't return the money in time, i can also be charged with a criminal offense.

Customers are penalized for mistakes and corporates are legally allowed to exploit them.

                Saw advert on Facial Pore Cleaner on Instagram on 26 feb and went to site to purchase. Site stated 'last 17 left* but after purchase, it remains as *last 17 left* hence suspected potential scam. Delivery states 12-20days, tried tracking on 26mar but tracking link says 'expired'. Contacted Hyperion and they claim it was stuck in transit and should arrive before 2 May and it did not. Contact them on 7 May and again they claim it was stuck somewhere. Till date, item did not arrive.

I only know them by the name : KELVIN and JASMINE



I am a victim of their deed.
I was too naive to hand them my products without first taking payment. As they insist they were going to resell them and could only pay me afterwards.
They have 5 very small children, this brought my guard down and i thought they were a honest couple just trying to make a living.

Did not contact me thereafter and block my number after i sent them a few texts.
I knew i was conned, my money gone...
Total worth of product passed to them was over $2000

Police report has been made. May Justice prevail over such SCHEMING and EVIL persons.

Guys pls beware of this 2 very cunning couple. They are wolves in sheeps' clothing.

They are known to be dealing and selling E - scooter products.

                I subscribed to the Academic Singles dating agency services online in Feb 2016. 

I unsubscribed electronically after 1 month, and did not receive any further messages. I thought that was the end.
In Feb 2017, the company billed my credit card company for auto renewal. 
The company makes it very difficult for users to terminate its services and uses various excuses to earn money for  services not rendered.

This is a scam organisation, their website should be banned.

However, I never knew I could be cheated as a result, where I was told to buy Taobao credit and transferred the money to her. She say she will come find me and also get a man to call me to verify I am not a police. Readily agreed, the man called me and asked me to make another deposit to taobao at Bishan.

  An urgent notice came to our bank today before we could finish the transfer of your funds to your account. The United Kingdom Government intercepted the transfer of your funds to your designated bank Account when a notice was sent to the government at the United Kingdom Board of Internal Revenue for approval of transfer. Late Mr. xxxxx had an outstanding Tax to pay before his untimely death and for this reason the United Kingdom Board of Internal Revenue had a scope on your newly upgraded account therefore currently suspending any form of transfer from the account.
 
  I have contacted their office via telephone conversation and they require that you make a payment for Tax Clearance. You are to pay 1.5% of £9,964,400.00 which amounts to £149,466. You are to effect the payment to the United Kingdom Board of Internal Revenue so that they can approve and authorize your transfer as soon as possible. All payment are to be made directly to the United kingdom Tax office.
 
   Note: Due to the hard cover insurance placed by Mr. Xxxxx on his account we cannot make any form of deductions as the funds has already left your SCB account. Failure by you to abide to the lay down procedures and regulations, the remittance of the fund would be stopped with immediate effect. Therefore, Standard Chartered Bank is hereby directed to stop further transfer modality of the above mentioned beneficiary until a TAX CLEARANCE CERTIFICATE is issued for the transfer of the said funds. We are very sorry for this unexpected situation. Please get back to the Board of Internal Revenue for approval of your transfer and tax clearance

                Got introduced to this ""investment platform"" last year - like a margin trading account

Min amount is USD10K & lockin for 1 year. Already 1 year now & they are giving excuses to delay my withdrawals. 

Should have caught the other red flags:
- website no detail on how the business works
- no public history on the founder
- no proper payment channel, everything is through bank transfers

Seems like ponzi scheme where the initial people are successful so they will help spread the word

                I signed a contract for a personal loan with this website - https://www.sollairesolutions.com
The agent I was working with is Arlene Foster.
I was skeptical at first, but I did as much research as I could and she talked a very good game. She said they were
BBB and FBI approved, and that they had no complaints against them, I couldn't find any complaints and
eventually came to the conclusion they were legit - well I was very wrong.
Due to my average - below average credit rating I had three options to secure my loan. I chose option #3, which
was to pay my first and last months monthly payments. The only payment option was to MoneyGram money order
the fund to them. This is where I was hesitant, but again, she convinced me. I'm not one to fall for this kind of stuff
either.
I was supposed to have the loan funds deposited into my account within 6-hours of making the payment.
I did not receive the funds, so I tried to contact her all day long but did not succeed. Eventually I contacted
customer service who gave me her ""manager's"" phone #. He then went on to say I owe an additional $450 before I
can have my funds released. This is where I knew I had been scammed.
Now I do not have the loan I was expecting and on top of that I am out an additional $540 from MoneyGram order
I sent to secure the loan. I NEEDED this money. She very well knew I had a mortgage payment to make yesterday
and a 5 year old son to care for and bu groceries for. I am in big trouble now as I do not have enough money to
pay my bills and mortgage after sending them that payment.
The phone # she provided during the ordeal was 1-800-767-2942. However, I just searched her site info using
scam advisor.com and I see that she has changed her # to 1-800-205-0568.
Customer service phone # is 1-800-767-2062 - He goes by the name of Robert. Her manager's phone # is
1-800-615-1298.

I replied to the advertisement, informing of my interest and left my contact number for the person to get in touch with me. Subsequently, I received a WhatsApp message from +667686846 asking about my interest. She introduced herself as Natasha and she is 39 years old. She told me that is no longer staying in Singapore and now move now moved to Thailand with her kittens. She gave me some details of her kitten. She asked my whereabouts, what I am doing, my family status, what I was working. She said that she is giving her kitten for free and she is unable to take care of them. She sent me some of her photos of her kittens. When I asked her a video, she denied to give me. She said that the kitten will receive in Singapore in 5 to 6 hours and I must pay the transportation fee which is SGD250. I said it was too expensive. She said she will help me pay SGD100 for the reservation and I pay SGD150 for the transportation fee. I agreed to her idea. Once I received the kitten I must return her back SGD100. However, when I asked for the name of the Singapore agency, she refused to give me the name that was dealing with transport of the kitten. After she paid the reservation fee, the agency located in Thailand, sent me the email copy of the invoice. I also received the call from +66967277350 claiming to be the agency and when I questioned him asking is they had a branch, he replied ""yes"", but refused to give me a name of the Singapore agency. and consistently told me to keep transferring the money through the Western Union stated on the invoice. When I could not locate the companies of the Thailand The agency, I found it suspicious and then realised that it was a possible scam. However, I did not make any cash transfer through western union. She was trying to call me continuously for around 3 to 4 days and asking for the payment. Subsequently she informed me that she was indeed a scammer. She said she will use my WhatsApp profile picture to scam other people. She even changed her profile picture to my picture.  I lodged complain to the nearest police station.

                I was randomly invited / added on Facebook by someone I don't know 

It happened over the last 2 weeks and my personal information was leaked. 

I reported to Facebook and Facebook refused to take down the profile. Hence I would need to block the Facebook profile and stop them from contacting me. 
Also, I have increased my privacy level to guard against such attacks. 

Thankfully, it was a personal information lost.

                Annamalai Ramanathan is a property agent. He is very nice and friendly, but is a scammer. He misrepresents himself saying he is an agent, when he is the owner and vice versa. He showed me very bad property which was cosmetically dressed to cover up fundamental problems. Luckily we came to know about this property through friends. We would have lost huge sums of money if we had proceeded with the purchase. Avoid this agent

They somehow have all my details and threatened to transfer 980$ + 20$ for legal service else you will be arrested and deport back to India.

I told, I need to verify with Police office before do any transfer.  Then scammer hang /drop the phone line.

I did not transfer money, It is Impersonation SCAM call.

                Surfed FB and this advertisement appeared - QuickMax eyelash extension serum. They requested me to leave my email address and home address to be contacted for future promotions/ product offerings. A few days later, I received a parcel of the product with invoice of GBP 100. I have contacted them advising that I did not order it and will return to their office. However, they kept insisting they did not receive it and have sent a late penalty fee requesting for more money.

He said that he lost his mobile and asked me to get a line & hp for him. He asked for cash to help with trading losses and also to invest in his uber rental service & limo business. All transactions are done in cash. He even asked me to get loans for him. When I pressed him for money, he said that he will pay later & cut off all communication.

                A mega Ponzi scheme, FxUnited, has been very active in Singapore since 2015 under different affiliates (IBs) operating and recruiting new investors and marketed as a forex trading platform using CGAT (Capital Gain Auto Trading) purportedly a “robot” software that can perform forex trading optimally to maximise profits. Most of the newer investors who joined FxUnited CGAT platform from mid-were unable to withdraw their bonuses or capital since June 2016. 

I am one of the newer investors who joined in mid-July 2016 after being constantly encouraged and influenced for more than a month by an acquaintance namely Khairilanuar, NRIC: S7113312E in a WhatsApp chat group of 7 persons. He would post photos SGD $1000 notes (up to $10,000) several times over a one month period in June and July. The chatgroup members and I were very sceptical as Khairilanuar mentioned that he was getting around $4000-$5000 monthly from affiliate commissions, his downlines and dividends from his own monies. I highlighted to him that this scheme was probably illegal and a pyramid scheme. But he explained and convinced me that there are quite a few FxUnited affiliates operating in Singapore and there are thousands that benefitted from this passive income scheme in Singapore. 

He also posted screenshots of his account transactions and names of other investors to convince me. I finally decided to join under two separate CGAT accounts. I invested a total of USD5000 (please note that FxUnited used conversion rate of USD1.00 to SGD1.55 for deposits, and I have also to add USD300 per account at the stated deposit rate to qualify for the CGAT accounts. The monies invested were transferred to a POSB bank account number 054-19284-3. Khirilanuar also helped to set up my online trading account with FxUnited providing me with the userIDs and passwords. Before joining, Khairilanuar promised that he can make monthly withdrawals on my behalf at the exchange rate of USD1.00 to SGD1.35. 

Less than a month later in August 2016, Khairilanuar informed me that FxUnited had unilaterally adjusted its withdrawal exchange rate downwards to USD1.25 and all withdrawals have to be made via Perfect Money platform which may take up to 4 to 8 weeks to be approved by FxUnited! I felt angry and short-changed but Khairilanuar assured me that everything was in order and he even arranged for the first dividend withdrawal $487.50 on my behalf. I got my first dividend from him via another POSB bank account 556-72738-4 via bank transfer.

After the first payment, I have yet to receive my other monthly dividends. I decided to withdraw all my capital in December 2016 and to date not a single cent of withdrawals was approved by FxUnited. Now FxUnited has introduced a “new product” called IMA (Intelligent Manager Account) to replace the CGAT scheme which has been made redundant. This IMA is actively promoted in Singapore as a forex based scheme but in fact a Ponzi scheme by another name.

                I ordered a elephant doll from ""cool stuff emporium"" back in September 2016. However, I have yet to receive the item. when I checked the website again on 8th Jan 2017, the website has been made unavailable. Then, I checked online about this company, and found out it is a scam. Many people had purchased the item from them and did not received the item. 

I have lodged a complain through Tasmania consumer affair's website. 
I hope this will alert the consumers here.

Met through OKCupid. Started chat and exchange mobile. He pointed how love should be committed (not about trying) and both must stand strong for the relationship. So, making me as committed too.

He asked for money when he had car accident (need to pay repair both cars), so $5k was loaned to be return end month. Lost his mobile, so applied line for him and his parents (whom he claim can use my corporate plan to save.). Missing in action now.

Total:$8.5k due to cash and termination of 3 lines.

After 50% deposit payment of $200 to seller POSB account 039854953 as requested, Before delivery seller request another $150 Insurance and $30 GST. I lodged a police report on 15 Dec 2016 & feedback to Qoo10 to remove the link to Trezo.sg but apparently Qoo10 up to this point had done nothing to protect buyer from being scam by letting Trezo.sg seller to post at it's website. Qoo10 is ignorance.

Subject: Misleading instructions and misappropriation of my money when I asked for a full withdrawal.

I opened an account with BdB with USD$250 on 19th Nov 2016 to test out how the system and platform looks like. Benjamin Novak contacted me and assured me that with an additional USD$10,000 injection from my side, I will receive BdB VIP signals, which will give me good profit returns and insured investment against losses. So I did another 2x USD$5,000

Streat Deals gave excuses after excuses after I pursued them. Then they said will refund monies to my bank. However, it has been over two months and they still have not transferred the money to me. Imagine if there are 10,000 orders everyday they can make over $100,000 daily by not refunding the monies at all. They amount may be small but clever scheme

My letter to Mobile Fusion
RE: DISPUTE ON CHARGES

Dear Sir,
I write with dismay to dispute on the total billing charges in the amount of $1,660.00 (see table below) by Mobilefusion that was billed to my Singtel account  for the period from 10 April 2015 to 10 October 2016. 

The amount is inaccurate because of the following reasons:
1.	I was cheated and was a victim of Telco scam.

2.	I neither filled nor signed on any form to agree on the Terms and Conditions.

3.	I was unaware of the “content and services” charges into my monthly Singtel bill because I was using e-bill statement and payment was by GIRO.

4.	I had forgotten my login password and had procrastinated in checking my monthly e-bill statements.

5.	I never ever suspected that a reputable SingTel can allow a content service provider to bill charges “Bill on behalf service” into my Singtel account with neither my knowledge nor informing me

6.	I have called Singtel at 1688 to enquire on what is “Bill on behalf service” is a good indication of my ignorance.

7.	I was surprised that the $20 weekly charges are for download of special ringtone, emoji and others that I am not interested and do not know how to do it.

8.	I do not know what webpage for downloading. I do not have the user account and password.

9.	I am sure there is a way to trace and track on the usage at the site login by the user account login and password used.

Please DO NOT victimise a 62 years old lady who only uses her hand phone for simple texting and to make calls. No other person uses my hand phone. There are no kids in my home except a pet dog.

Please investigate into this matter and return the amount of $1,660.00 by a cheque to be sent to my home address as soon as possible.

Enclosed are copies of my SingTel bills to support my claim for reimbursements

The automated voice message claimed that I had an uncollected parcel and that I could connect to an operator by pressing '9'.

I'm one of their victims.We start communicate at Carousell on 22/8/16 under their username Rusticadventurer. After get clear explanation and confirmation that they will do the measurement about goods that i wanted to buy which is 8x8 wardrobe(RM699) and table top(RM249),they ask for 50% deposit to lock promotion price before it end.On 23/8/16 i paid Rm500 via maybank online banking to Herizal Ellroy Osman account number 1511 2828 6099.Communicate with them was very pleasant,speedy replied and fast respond with good character. No one will suspect they were actually an online scammer.At 8.21pm,sameday.Lysa whatsapps me to come and do measurement.While im outside,i ask her to come on 25/8/16. On 25/8/16 at 11.50pm they arrived at my house and do measurement for both stuff.Very young and kind,plus herizal & lysa have a good looking.However,my good impression to them change to bad when after a month they keep giving lots of excuses. From 22/9/16 until today 12/11/16 after 17times my follow-up to them,they still unable to deliver my stuff.Sometimes they said their stools damaged,handphone damaged so cannot communicate with me eventhough i saw she read the whatsapps,then latest update on 2/11/16,she said she at overseas while she promised to deliver my stuff on 30/10/16.She also promised to refund all my deposit if they unable to deliver it on 30/10/16. Now keep saying that no roaming at overseas,cannot perform transaction.How could you go overseas while you know you have a duty here?I felt uneasy then i checked their account at Carousell.The account has been suspended. I saw others comments,also being cheated by them.On 8/11/16 I reported to Carousell. Carousell confirmed that they received similar feedback about this seller from other buyer and advise me to lodge a police report for futher action.On 11/11/16 i lodge a police report to makesure this scammer think twice before they scammed and cheated people again and again and refund my deposit.

- 1 blanket instead of 2
- that one blanket wasn't even the design I ordered. 

So I wrote an email to them requesting for refund, they asked me:
- to wait for the other blanket to arrive
- No further response until I threatened to go to relevant authority

                I let myself get fooled.  I apply for loan in hour .  I received 300 then pay it the next day 400. The agent say it's not enough for there's still 50 reg fee and other fee of 50. All in all 500. They say must pay one time. They will refund the money end of month. To cut story short pay 500 again scared it will grow bigger. Now no response anymore. I want to catch them they are so heartless. Don't want this to happen to anybody.  Please don't do same with me. :(

                Due to the nature of my work, I do pick up unknown Singaporean numbers. Most of the time, it happens to be who I think it is. However, today (Oct 5, 2016), at 1:53pm, I received a call from (+6566915999). It was an automated English female recording, claiming that it is from the police office and that they need my IC. At that point, I hung up the phone. It was about 13 sec by then. It seems like I didn't lose anything from my bank or phone company. But I don't know if any information is lost.

                I received a call with an automated message in Mandarin stating that it is the police headquarters. Instructed me to report to police headquarters with my NRIC, if I failed to do so, actions would be taken against me. Was told to press '2'. I know it's a scam as any government body will be using English first until you requested to speak in Mandarin.

I did not violate any law, so obviously this is a scam.

                In 2011, I was introduced to a company by my friend after I expressed interest in investment. My friend introduced an agent who was around my age and appeared to be successful. I was brainwashed to take part in their ""investment project"" which include jade, silver and overseas property at incredibly low risk and high returns. I should have known that it was sketchy as we had to do cash transaction but i was brainwashed. Made police report in 2013 but was told that the contract was not valid.

The moment I picked up the call, I heard an automated voice saying in Chinese with a Chinese accent saying This is from 999. Once I heard it, I immediately knew it is a scam call because it has been so common and known in Singapore. So I hung up in seconds. Didn't lose any things however I am surprised by how they got my number since mine is a prepaid number that I didn't gave to a lot of sources.

will the SPF ever utilize a phonecall, no matter how serious the crime ( e.g. small crimes ) to contact a suspect?

I need it urgently, so cant wait, so i decided to ask for refund. If ure a seller and always busy then why be a seller? I mean i understand they have their own life but at least take some iniative la. 

Eventually he agreed to meetup. On the day itself, i msg him if we're meeting, last min say cannot wanted to meetup the next day. But i cant wait and asked for a refund since so hard to meetup. Cos too lazy to delay any longer. But he said ""u cant just cancel order like that man i alr got the item frim supplier"" but the post stated ALL INSTOCK. I dont get it. So he suggested mailing. I aggred. 

So item mailed on the 13/07/2017. Never receive items since then, so i was asked to wait a lil longer, and will check with Singpost.

On the 03/07/2016, i decided to msg him for updates. So he replied, saying he will send me the new ones. Funny thing, i msg him on the 12/07/2016 to check if he has mailed the items, he replied ""soon! sorry! ive been really busy with projects and all"" sugested to meetup again! But i was busy with hari raya preparations. And anw he is always not free! 

Then i rmbr till now 03/09/2016 i havent gotten the items i purcased for $17.50. not be a big sum of money. But its ur responsibily. Demand for a refund but he had yet to reply. Worst exeperience from Carousel! Utterly dissapointed!!

                I received a call this morning from number 999. Although a little shocked I decided not to take the call and let it go into voicemail. Few minutes later I checked my voicemail and the recording was something like 'please press 2' in Mandarin. I'm really glad I didn't take the call.

Called into the non urgent police hotline to report this. The only info I needed to provide was my telco company.

                Automated voice calling system by the other party. Beware of this calls which is happening lately. They claim that they are from 999 police and that there is a breach of security of the parcel that I am expecting. 
After prompting more, scammer hang up their call when they suspect you can no longer be a victim to them. 
There are so many calls coming from scam companies and locals should be very careful of this.

                I found an ad on property guru for a single room. I checked that the person was a legitimate PROPNEX agent.

I visited him multiple times and checked the room and even met his wife and daughter. 

I  agreed to rent it at $1250/month and transferred him a 1 month deposit and first month's rent. A total of $2500 upon signing an agreement. I was to move in in 3 weeks. 

He then contacted me saying he had to move out and would refund my money. He then disappeared and I could not get my money back.

                I came across this profile on Facebook by the name of Wendy Adams and 'she' was really attractive. The photos used in the profile was no other than a well-known Vietnamese model, Elly Tran-Ha. The person was posing as a social escort working for the company, Swingers Convention Bay. 

In short, to seek out 'her' services, I had to transfer money via Money Gram to Albert Fernandez Lee in Caloocan, Philippines 1400. I was told to send 300 SGD. They did not reply to me after that.

                Beware deceptive practices coming from staff at the the Ascot hotel group which Chee Koon Lee is fully aware of as the CEO. I emailed his staff before booking flights to find the lowest rate and cheapest room and was deceived. I wanted to find out before booking flights because i knew i couldn't change them without paying hefty penalties. They advised $198 was the cheapest. After booking my flights, i discovered the 21 day advance booking offers a $154 rate. They didn't tell me about this when i emailed them. I find this is very deceptive method to use in order to trick guests into paying more money they need to. Considering this would have been the 3rd time i booked rooms with Ascot, i feel robbed and look down at Ascot Hotel group how should right a wrong and give me the lowest rate as a valued guest. Rather, they are continuing to blame me and still trying to get more than the $154 per night they should have disclosed to me when i emailed them. Very low ethical standards by a ruthless businessman how puts money before regular guests. Shame on you and your family Lee Koon Chee!

                Joseph Hui is a rogue event organiser who cheats money from K-pop fans. 

He would set up fake companies and sell tickets for non-existent events to K-pop fans.

After selling the tickets, he would declare the events cancelled and not return the money.

Police reports have been made by the aggrieved fans but Joseph Hui remains at large. On his recent facebook page, he seems to have gone to South Korea for a tour recently.
