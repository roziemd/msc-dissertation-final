      " i met clifford weng on meeff. he claimed to be half thai dad and singaporean chinese ministry of manpower but born and raised in usa florida. works in oil and gas industry. we chatted on whatsapp and he always texted me in the morning and night every day without fail. he told me a lot of personal details about himself and his girlfriend cheated on him last year and was heartbroken. week later, he started to tell me that he has feelings for me and will send me flirty messages. he frequently send me selfie of himself. weeks later, he told me that there is an important contract that he is bidding for and will be doing some shopping to prepare for his contract. the next day, he told me that he went shopping and he thought of me and bought some gifts for me and asked me for my shipping address so that he can send the gifts to me. i rejected him initially but he insisted that he wanted to do this due to his appreciation for me giving him back his faith in trust and friendship during his lowest time when he was emotionally drained due to his past relationship and he really appreciated my support as a good friend. he sounded so sincere so i gave him my contact details and address. he gave me the courier tracking link and the tracking number the next day. week later the malaysia custom texted me via whatsapp that my package has arrived in malaysia and i need to pay s to clear custom and overweight charges before they can deliver the package and i need to pay it as soon as possible before delivery insurance expires. i asked the customs to send it back to the sender but they said that it is not possible. i asked clifford what was included inside the package that weighed over kg and he told me that he send me expensive perfume, massager, female accessories, watches and cash of usdk for my inconvenience as i need to pay the excess charges and he urged me to pay them as soon as possible so as not to waste his effort of sending me the gifts. i requested the custom to show me proof of the package and the declaration of the items inside, they claimed that they are unable to do so. i told clifford that i do not have the money to pay for it and he suddenly accused me of being ungrateful and how i do not appreciate all his effort in trying to make me smile. i also googled for the courier company and it seems fishy and fake hence i suspected that there is no such package in the first place. thankfully i found this website after googling which showed many similar scams that happened before. i have reported and blocked them since. hopefully this story helps to prevent others from getting scammed too. \n",

      " i received a robocall in english, followed by a similar message in mandarin from this number. thereafter, i pressed and the call was redirected and picked up by a person he sounded like a local who said that he was from the high courts and that i had been summoned by the courts and needed to attend a court hearing on the coming monday at am. when inquired on the nature of the summons, he requested for my name to check. thereafter, he requested for my identity number number and that was when i hesitated and declined to furnish it to him. he claimed that two summons had been sent and since there was no reply, i was now required to attend court. when i questioned him on how was that possible since i was definitely home during the last weeks given the covid shutdown, he sounded curt and was not unable to provide a coherent response. when i requested to speak to his supervisor, he became unhelpful and our call ended. hope this sharing helps in avoiding others from getting scammed. \n",

    "- Between January and April 2020, a total of 5,425 cases of scams were reported to the SPF. Of this number, 394 were connected to Covid-19. \n",
    "- They are broadly categorised into three types:\n",
    "1. E-commerce scams, such as those related to the sale of face masks and hand sanitisers\n",
    "2. Impersonation scams where perpetrators pretended to be officials from the Ministry of Health so that they could retrieve the victims’ personal data and information\n",
    "3. Phishing scams which typically involved fraudulent emails and phone text messages containing fake offers or false information on payouts disbursed by the Government. This is done with the aim of tricking the victims into sharing their credit or debit card details or their one-time passwords (OTP) for access to accounts.\n",
