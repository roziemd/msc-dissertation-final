(but people have lost money) Zu Lan's email  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Thank you for replying to me. My name is Zhu Lan, 36 years old, a single and non-smoker lady. I am willing to rent the room. I am at sea at the moment as i work on a cruise ship as a Chef offshore of Philippines I will be living and working down there as my contract here is coming to an end that's why I am coming there. But due to the nature of my work of having a busy schedule, phone calls making and visiting websites are restricted, I only squeezed out time to check this advert and send you a message so I won't be able to come for the viewing myself. I will like you to kindly calculate the total cost covering my first six months rent together with a deposit and I will be staying for long as your room is available. Please kindly get back to me with some pictures of the room and your address for me to forward it to my mover agent to calculate the total cost of moving my stuff over there. I have attached my IC with this email for you to have a view of me. Looking forward to read back from you soon. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\""

       "\"I was approached by a lady from china who goes by the name 'jiang lin' on wechat. She claims to be from a well-to-do family from beijing and has an uncle who is a financial expert. After a couple of text exchanges she introduced me to invest in a cryptocurrency known as obb, trading on a cryptocurrency online platform known as bftbit (www.bftbit.com). Bftbit turns out to be a fake trading platform and obb is a non-existent cryptocurrency. Once monies are deposited into bftbit it goes directly to the scammers, although on bftbit it reflects as deposited into your bftbit account and no matter how you try to withdraw the monies, the withdrawal status would remain as processing. In the beginning i was very skeptical and refused to believe her. But a moment of greed and too smart for my own good led me to foolishly believe in her and lost an unrecoverable sum of s$14,500. The modus operandi: 1) she would first introduce that she had been into this obb investment for 3 years under the guidance of her financial expert uncle who guides her to invest at the relevant time on bftbit which most of the time would be profit-making as the uncle knows the market. 2) she would ask you to invest in a small sum of us$500 first which would make profits after 2 rounds of investment on bftbit. She would also provide step-by-step guidance [i.e. buying of cryptocurrency on huobi (an authentic ans well-known cryptocurrency exchange incorporated in singapore), transferring of currency from huobi to bftbit, making trades in obb on bftbit and withdrawal and transferring of a small sum of currency from bftbit to huobi (this withdrawal is to make one believe that bftbit is an authentic trading platform but in fact the withdrawal is done by the scammers)]. From there, she would entice you to invest in us$10,000 as her uncle predicts that a big market trend is coming, thus earning more profit. 3) she would then suggest to make a joint trade of usd$20,000 which would require us$30,000 as security deposit. In order to gain your trust, she would transfer us$40,000 into your bftbit account. Once you transfer your us$10,000 into the account it is gone forever. 4) at the time when you (and her) are jointly trading on the obb big market trend, the trading system would stop for unknown reason and when you refresh the trading system you would realise that the joint trade suffers an 80% loss. From there, she would claim to be your fault and ask for refund of her us$40,000. 5) a much serious concern is that in setting up your account with bftbit you need to furnish a copy of your nric which is at the scammers' disposal.\""
